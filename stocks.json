The worries over China\u2019s economy have been visible for months in Hong Kong, where stocks plunged 14 percent last year, the fourth consecutive annual decline.The new year hasn\u2019t offered any relief, either, and economic data released by China on Wednesday prompted another sell-off.\nIn Hong Kong, where many of China\u2019s biggest companies trade, stocks fell 3.7 percent on Wednesday. So far this year, the market has lost one-tenth of its value. In China\u2019s financial capital of Shanghai, stocks dropped 2.1 percent, extending this year\u2019s decline to nearly 5 percent.Even as China said its economy grew by 5.2 percent in 2023, which is high by most standards, it is undergoing significant change. China\u2019s leaders are trying to wean the country off property and construction, which have long been pillars of growth, while also reducing reliance on borrowed money.An anticipated boom in consumption after China reversed its \u201czero Covid\u201d policy in late 2022 hasn\u2019t played out, either.A shrinking population and aging work force are adding to the headwinds. China on Wednesday also said its population had shrunk by two million people and was aging rapidly, putting further strain on its already weak health care system and underfunded state pension.While China\u2019s economy has shown some slight improvement recently, \u201cthe recovery clearly remains shaky,\u201d economists at Capital Economics wrote in a report.\nReal estate and consumer companies were among the worst hit by the sell-off in Hong Kong, which for years has been a gateway for foreign investors wanting to put money into mainland China. Longfor Group, a Chinese property developer, fell 6.8 percent, while Meituan, the Chinese delivery service, dropped 7 percent.Stocks in the United States this year so far are flat, while share prices in Japan are surging, up over 6 percent.Many investors have been looking to China to fire up its economy with a big stimulus as it has in the past during economic stress, but policymakers have said this time is different.Mr. Li reiterated this reluctance in his address at the World Economic Forum. \u201cWe have held to avoiding major stimulus,\u201d he said, \u201cand have not sought short-term growth at the price of accumulating long-term risks.\u201d",

	"text": "The S&P 500 index closed at a record on Friday, crossing above its old high-water mark, set in early 2022. The gains show that investors have overcome fears of rising interest rates and panic about a recession that had governed stock trading for much of the past two years.Instead, they\u2019re now betting that a drop in rates will help expand corporate profits, while the economy stays on a relatively solid footing.\nEven though the S&P 500 had struggled to push into the record \u2014 having bumped up against it for weeks before finally crossing above with jump on Friday \u2014 the record high should also put an end to a debate on Wall Street about whether the recent run-up in shares reflected a lasting shift in sentiment, or if it was just a rebound that would fade as fear over the outlook for the economy returned.For the average person, it does not matter what label analysts are applying to the stock market when it is heading higher, but with the new high, they will be hearing a lot more about the \u201cbull market.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what to know about the market now.What makes this a bull market?\u201cBull market\u201d isn\u2019t an official designation. There is no governing body that says what it is, or decides when it started (as there is with a recession). But on Wall Street, there are two common ways the label gets applied.One says a bull market is confirmed when a major index like the S&P 500 climbs 20 percent above its most recent low. By that standard, the bull market was confirmed in June, when the S&P 500 closed 20 percent above its October 2022 low.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But some people were quick to dismiss the standard as too easy for the market to meet. They use the second definition for a bull market, in which stocks have to rise past their old high.As of Friday, by both measures, the S&P 500 is in the midst of a bull market.When did the bull market start?The current bull market started in October 2022, when the S&P 500 reached its most recent low. Since then, the index has swelled about 35 percent.How long do bull markets last?A bull market can last more than a decade or a few months. Stocks are in a bull market more often than not.\nThe previous bull market lasted less than two years, starting in March 2020 and ending in January 2022. Before that, stocks were in a bull market that lasted nearly a decade, from March 2009 amid the Great Recession to February 2020, as Covid-19 emerged as a global threat.When was the last S&P 500 record?The index hit a record on Jan. 3, 2022, the first day of trading that year. Low interest rates and high consumer spending, fueled by stimulus checks and the rollout of the coronavirus vaccines, helped bolster it.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cThere was a euphoria surrounding what we were tasting as postpandemic life,\u201d said John Lynch, chief investment officer for Comerica Wealth Management.But just days later, the Federal Reserve released details of a meeting that suggested the central bank was worried about inflation and would start raising rates to slow the economy. The index ended that week about 2.5 percent lower, the start of a bumpy decline that continued until October, when stocks were 27 percent below the January peak.The Fed began its rate-increase campaign in March 2022, which raised the cost of borrowing for companies and consumers. Worried about a recession, investors dumped stocks as the Fed progressively raised rates from near zero to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, the highest in 22 years.\nThen data began to point toward a cooling labor market, and inflation began to moderate. Investors started to bet that the Fed was nearly done with its campaign, and once the central bank signaled that it was considering lowering rates in 2024, the drop reversed and stocks rallied past that old high.What does a bull market mean for ordinary investors?Maybe nothing. Certainly the fact that stocks are climbing is good news for those with a 401(k) retirement plan, and even better news for people who have large investments in the stock market (often higher-income Americans).But the record should not change most investors\u2019 behavior, said Mark Wilson, a financial adviser at MILE Wealth Management in Irvine, Calif. Mr. Wilson advises his clients not to make decisions based on day-to-day news in financial markets, he said. Often news that the stock market is high will set off fears that it is bound to drop.\u201cPeople picture the stock market like a heart monitor that goes up and goes down, so some get nervous,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. Although the stock market has hiccups and does not break records every day, it generally trends up over time, he added.For people investing for the long term, Mr. Wilson said, what is important is the value of their assets when they need the cash. Plus, it is important to recognize that the S&P 500 is just one index; a pension or retirement plan will invest money across asset classes that may not all be up at the same time.\nWhat does this mean for the economy?Higher share prices can encourage companies to expand, and for the 60 percent of Americans who own stocks, a bull market means they might feel slightly wealthier because their long-term savings are worth more. That might make them feel better about their finances, but what is more likely to make them spend more is the size of their paychecks, according to Rupert Watson, an economist at Mercer, an asset manager.\u201cThe most important thing for people on average incomes is whether they have a job and whether their wage is going up,\u201d he said.What would end the bull market?A bull market ends when stocks fall 20 percent below their last high \u2014 a period known as a bear market.The last time the S&P 500 entered a bear market was in 2022, as investors recoiled in the face of stubborn inflation and rising interest rates.But even if stocks do not fall that far, they could get knocked back some.Inflation is moderating, but some analysts warn that it is too early to declare victory. Prices rose 3.4 percent on a yearly basis in December, down from a 9.1 percent peak in 2022 but still higher than the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2 percent target.\nIf inflation trends unexpectedly go in the wrong direction, the Fed may not cut rates as soon as investors are hoping.\u201cThe single most important thing that could reverse the rally is inflation not coming down,\u201d Mr. Watson said.",

	"text": "The stock market broke through to new heights on Friday, with the S&P 500 index finally hitting a record after weeks of bumping up against its previous peak.The index, one of the most widely watched Wall Street benchmarks and a cornerstone of many portfolios, rose 1.2 percent to close above the high that was set in January 2022.The record followed a staggering rally in the final months of 2023, as investors seized on signs of slowing inflation and signals from the Federal Reserve that it could begin to lift the brakes off the economy by cutting interest rates. But after coming within a hair of the high in late December, the market lost some momentum as some measures of inflation continued to run hot, crucial shipping lanes in the Middle East came under attack and fears that the market had climbed too far too fast lingered.The rally that finally pushed stocks over the edge was rooted in gains among influential tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia, though the ferocious rally that lifted the valuations of these companies last year has become more mixed in 2024. On Friday, a closely followed survey of consumers showed a big rise in economic confidence paired with muted expectations for inflation, bolstering hopes for the economy.\nA market high won\u2019t eliminate anxiety about a potential recession or the risk that interest rates stay high longer than investors currently expect, said Tom Logue, a strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network. But it will help maintain some optimism on Wall Street, he said.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cTo the everyday investor, to the retail investor, it\u2019s a positive thing,\u201d Mr. Logue said. \u201cPsychologically, it has an impact in people\u2019s heads when prices hit an all-time high.\u201dIt has taken about two years for the index to recover from a slide set in motion by fears that a budding inflation problem would push the Fed to try to slow the price increases and, with them, the economy. That slide ended 10 months later after concern about an impending recession began to give way to hope in the resilience of the economy. With inflation slowing in recent months, investors also began to anticipate a change of course from Fed policymakers.The bet that rates will come down in 2024 has given the S&P 500 its latest push, taking its rise to about 35 percent from its October 2022 low. The record on Friday also helped confirm a new bull market \u2014 Wall Street parlance for a period of exuberance that pushes stocks further into new territory.The S&P 500\u2019s record is a psychological signpost for investors, partly because the companies in the index account for more than three-quarters of the value of the U.S. stock market, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. About $11.4 trillion in funds and other assets are benchmarked to the S&P 500, making its ups and downs a preoccupation of almost every investment manager.\nInvestors enjoyed roughly a decade and a half of gains through the index\u2019s previous bull market, which ended in early January 2022. The latter stages were fueled partly by pandemic stimulus measures and low interest rates, but that gave way to a surge in inflation to 40-year highs, spurring policymakers at the Fed into action.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The Fed\u2019s rapid increase in interest rates, starting in March 2022, sent shock waves through financial markets, forcing an abrupt adjustment to a new world of higher borrowing costs after more than a decade of rock-bottom rates made borrowing cheap and encouraged investors to take more risks in the search for higher returns.Stubborn inflation, despite a series of jumbo rate increases, stoked fears that the Fed would crush the economy while trying to wrestle prices under control. That dragged stocks down and pulled the S&P 500 into a bear market in 2022, erasing more than 20 percent of its value from January to October.But stocks began to rise again, as companies and the economy showed far greater resilience than most investors expected. Consumers kept spending, powering economic growth and allowing companies to continue raising their prices aggressively, bolstering profits.A further tailwind came from advancements in artificial intelligence, and bets on the technology\u2019s ability to generate big profits well into the future. Nvidia, the chipmaker, was one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend: Its stock has risen more than 400 percent since the S&P 500 hit its low, making it one of the handful of companies worth more than $1 trillion in market value.\nIt joined Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla as one of the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d stocks, which have had an outsize impact on the performance of the S&P 500 because of their size.The S&P 500 is weighted by market capitalization, meaning that moves of the biggest companies contribute far more to the performance of the index. Adjusting the index to give every company equal weight would put the S&P 500 about 5 percent below its record, highlighting the hefty contribution of this small number of stocks.As inflation has fallen and confidence in the economy\u2019s prospects has risen, this dynamic has begun to shift, with a broader set of companies contributing to the market rally.The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies that tend to be more sensitive to changes in the U.S. economy than the multinationals in the S&P 500, has also risen over the past couple of months. But it remains roughly 20 percent from its record, set in late 2021.That makes some analysts think that there is more room for the rally to run, with slowing inflation set to breathe new life into the market. Traders in the futures market are now betting that the Fed could begin to lower rates as soon as March. If that view changed substantially \u2014 because of a cautionary note from the central bank or economic data that undermines the outlook \u2014 it could lead to a rocky stretch for stocks.The S&P 500\u2019s rally over the past 15 months has been periodically derailed by such moments of retreat, with setbacks on the path to lower inflation, mixed earnings from major companies, and economic threats stemming from the war in Ukraine and the widening conflict in the Middle East.There are other reasons for caution, with many economists predicting that the economy will slow in 2024, at the same time that consumers begin to buckle under the weight of expensive credit card debt and other borrowing.",

	"text": "If you\u2019ve been in the stock market for a while, congratulations. Now that the market has reached a new peak, you\u2019ve probably made some money.And if the news of a new market peak is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market \u2014 or perhaps drawing you in for the first time \u2014 this is a good moment to reflect on whether you have the emotional and financial resources to get in and stick with it for the long run.The S&P 500 on Friday surpassed the peak it reached on Jan. 3, 2022. After a miserable performance in 2022, the stock market had a fabulous run. Bond prices rose, too. These increases lifted investment portfolios around the world. Celebrate, by all means.But then get past it. If you are a long-term investor, this particular market peak isn\u2019t likely to matter.\nStaying in the market for decades, and reaping the full rewards of compound returns, including reinvested dividends, is a far surer road to prosperity than trying to time the market\u2019s peaks and valleys.Hundreds of PeaksStock market peaks come and go. Much of Wall Street is occupied with forecasts of when these events will happen \u2014 and advice on when it\u2019s best to buy and sell.This broad approach generally hasn\u2019t worked well, the data shows. I wouldn\u2019t base investment decisions on the timing of market peaks and valleys, not if you\u2019re investing for the long haul.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The reason is that over the next few decades there will be hundreds of stock market peaks, if history is any guide. If you\u2019re able to stay invested in the market through all of them, you are likely to prosper.Consider that if the latest market peak turns out to be memorable, we will all be in serious trouble. It would mean that this will be the last market peak for a long time to come \u2014 and that the market\u2019s long-term march upward has halted.\nThat could happen. The stock market\u2019s rise isn\u2019t inevitable. Stocks were down for almost two years in the latest cycle \u2014 which is why this peak has gotten so much attention \u2014 and they have at times failed to return to past peak levels for extended periods, notably in the 1930s.But since 1926, the U.S. market has been in a long \u2014 though frequently interrupted \u2014 upward trend. There are certain to be major setbacks along the way. But as long as capitalism continues to function, the stock market is likely to levitate so that before long the latest rally will be seen as nothing more than a tiny blip on an extended stock chart.That\u2019s why the amount of time you stay in the market \u2014 not whether you buy and sell at opportune moments \u2014 is likely to be what really matters.Sticking Around in Index FundsThink about what\u2019s happened in the U.S. market since August 1976.For the kind of investing I practice \u2014 and a core approach emerging from academic research about finance \u2014 it makes sense to start then.Though the wider world scarcely noticed at the time \u2014 and I certainly didn\u2019t \u2014 the summer of the U.S. bicentennial was a turning point in investing for working people. It was when Vanguard, under John C. Bogle, made it possible for people with modest means to put money into the broad stock market without having to incur hefty fees, buy individual stocks or rely on supposedly expert advice on when to buy and sell.\nInstead, for the first time, they could use low-cost index funds, which have become immensely popular, in traditional form or as exchange-traded funds, and are now offered by many companies. But Vanguard started it, with an innovation that is available today both as an S&P 500 index fund and as an E.T.F. In all its incarnations, the Vanguard fund has been cheap: It now carries a cost of only .04 percent, a tiny fraction of the expenses that investors back then had to incur \u2014 and, often, still do \u2014 when buying individual stocks through the auspices of a broker.Thanks to index funds like this one, holding the broad market and automatically reinvesting all your dividends is easy. You can buy it on your own or through a 401(k) from your employer. The numbers that follow don\u2019t account for expenses, but the costs of index funds are low enough that these numbers are reasonably close to those you would have experienced, for better or for worse, if you had held an S&P 500 index fund.Compound ReturnsSince August 1976, the broad S&P 500 has risen so much that none of the many declines over that long period amount to much in comparison with the broad upward thrust of the market.The worst bear market in that period will still be fresh in the memories of many investors. It occurred from Oct. 9, 2007, to March 9, 2009, a period often referred to as the great financial crisis. From peak to trough in that period, the stock market fell 56.8 percent, according to data provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.\nThe losses in that stretch were horrible, and they serve as a reminder of the importance of broad diversification \u2014 not just in stocks but in high-quality bonds, especially Treasuries, which served as a portfolio buffer and provided reassurance to people who needed to draw on all their emotional reserves to stay fully invested.Despite that fierce bear market \u2014 and six others, including the pandemic bear market that began on Jan. 3, 2022 \u2014 these are the returns of the S&P 500 over the long haul from Aug. 31, 1976, through November, according to Bloomberg:Based on price alone, the S&P 500 rose 8.4 percent, annualized, or a cumulative 4,338.6 percent.Including dividends reinvested regularly in the index, the total return of the S&P 500 was 11.4 percent annualized, or a cumulative 16,145.4 percent.That, in a nutshell, is the miracle of compounding. Individual market peaks and troughs for long-term investors were irrelevant. What mattered was staying in the U.S. market throughout the entire period. That would have been true even without dividends. But when you factor in dividends \u2014 which flow right back into your index fund and are used to purchase new fund shares, which generate more dividends, and on and on \u2014 the results are mind boggling.Imagine that you had been wise enough to put $1,000 into the index fund on its first day in 1976 and to have been patient enough to have let your pot of money grow through November. Your $1,000 would have increased by $161,454.Future PeaksThere\u2019s no assurance that the decades ahead will produce returns like these. And, in fact, academic finance generally recommends that you hold a piece of the entire global stock market, not just the S&P 500. The U.S. market could well underperform other global markets in the decades ahead, and the S&P 500 doesn\u2019t even capture the performance of the entire U.S. market.Furthermore, the bad stretches that have already occurred in global stock markets \u2014 and that will be coming in the decades ahead \u2014 point out the importance of diversifying with other assets: bonds and enough cash to let you pay the bills when the markets crash.\nOnce that\u2019s done, though, what isn\u2019t important, in the larger scheme of things, is timing market peaks and troughs. During the great financial crisis, for example, I spent an inordinate amount of time as a journalist speaking with so-called experts about when they thought the stock market would rise or fall. In retrospect, I believe that was a waste of time.Suppose you had gotten the market cycle as wrong as you possibly could, but had nonetheless decided to become a long-term stock investor \u2014 and had actually stuck with it, despite colossal losses. That would have meant buying at the market peak of Oct. 9, 2007. You would have lost most of your money by the spring of 2009, but you would have gained it back, and then some. These are the returns of the S&P 500 from Oct. 7, 2007, through Jan. 18, according to FactSet:Considering price alone, the index gained 7.1 percent annualized, or 207 percent cumulatively.With reinvested dividends, the index gained 9.3 percent annualized, or 325 percent cumulatively.I concede immediately that you could have done better than this by buying and selling at \u201cthe right times.\u201dThat would have entailed knowing in real time when the market was going to rise and fall, and no one knows that reliably over long periods. You could also have bought and sold the right stocks. Just owning Apple, for example, and nothing else, in the same period, and never selling it would have given you a total return of 3,760 percent. If you did that, bravo.But what\u2019s the right stock or stocks to buy for the next 15 years, and what\u2019s the optimal time to buy or sell? Some people will undoubtedly get the answers right.I\u2019m not even going to try. This market peak means many things to many people. I take it merely as further affirmation of the wisdom of long-term, low-cost buy-and-hold investing. Let\u2019s put this peak behind us, and hope for many, many more.",

In a sign of the times, the phrase has been scrubbed from the World Economic Forum\u2019s official program in Davos, Switzerland, after being on the agenda in previous years.Investors pulled $5 billion out of E.S.G.-focused \u201csustainable\u201d investment funds last quarter, according to a new report by Morningstar. The withdrawals came amid a wider market rally at the end of 2023.For the full year, $13 billion was pulled from E.S.G. funds. All in all, it was the \u201cworst calendar year on record,\u201d wrote Alyssa Stankiewicz, Morningstar\u2019s director of sustainability research.\nEven the bulls are changing their narrative. Larry Fink\u2019s BlackRock, a longtime champion of the E.S.G. investment strategy, has grown quieter on the issue as political tensions rise, especially among Republican lawmakers. The brunt of the outflows last year were from a single iShares E.S.G. fund managed by BlackRock.The E.S.G. market is still worth trillions, attracting a wide swath of investors looking for solid returns and motivated by a cause they believe in. The median return for the larger E.S.G. funds was a decent 20.8 percent last year, according to Morningstar, although that trailed the S&P 500.But investors\u2019 returns are off their 2021 peak, hurt by rising interest rates and the lack of regulation that would better define which stocks qualify as E.S.G., Morningstar noted. It added that the political heat is also having a chilling effect. Last month, House Republicans stepped up their scrutiny of fund giants such as BlackRock and State Street over their E.S.G. investing strategy.Wall Street has responded. Fund managers liquidated 16 such funds last quarter and opened seven, the second consecutive quarter in which closures outpaced newcomers.",

	"text": "Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, stunned investors by demanding that the company\u2019s board give him shares worth more than $80 billion if it wants him to continue developing products based on artificial intelligence.In the latest demonstration of his disregard for conventional ways of communicating with investors, Mr. Musk said late Monday on X, the social media site he owns, that he needed to own 25 percent of Tesla to avoid takeovers and have enough control of the company as it develops robots and other artificial intelligence technology.If his demands are not met, Mr. Musk said, he would pursue unspecified ventures outside of Tesla. In addition to electric cars, Tesla has been developing a humanoid robot called Optimus, and uses artificial intelligence to develop self-driving technology, a cornerstone of the company\u2019s strategy. Those businesses belong to Tesla, and Mr. Musk could not simply walk away with them.The company\u2019s stock market valuation of almost $700 billion \u2014 more than twice as much as Toyota Motor, the world\u2019s largest automaker by annual car sales \u2014 is predicated in part on investors\u2019 belief that the company will lead the rest of the industry in developing cars that can drive from place to place without human intervention. Investors are also betting that advanced automation will allow Tesla to manufacture cars much more efficiently and profitably than rivals.\nMr. Musk owns 13 percent of Tesla after selling a substantial portion of his stake to finance his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter, which he renamed X. The social media site has struggled under his leadership and has plunged in value. An additional 12 percent of Tesla would be worth $83 billion at the current share price, effectively recouping Mr. Musk\u2019s investment in Twitter \u2014 which he has said he regrets \u2014 and then some.\u201cI am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in A.I. & robotics without having ~25% voting control,\u201d Mr. Musk wrote on X. \u201cEnough to be influential, but not so much that I can\u2019t be overturned.\u201dHe went on: \u201cUnless that is the case, I would prefer to build products outside of Tesla.\u201d But he also said the board would take no action until a Delaware judge ruled in a lawsuit brought by a Tesla shareholder challenging an earlier compensation plan that was instrumental in making Mr. Musk the richest person in the world.Mr. Musk testified in the Delaware case in late 2022. Gregory Varallo, who represents shareholders in the lawsuit, said he did not know when there would be a ruling. No documents have been filed in the case since July.Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.The demand by Mr. Musk underlined the extent to which Tesla, which sold 1.8 million vehicles last year, is subject to his impulses.\n\u201cYou\u2019re never really sure what you\u2019re going to read from Elon Musk when you get back to the office after a three-day weekend,\u201d said Ben Rose, president of Battle Road Research, which advises institutional investors. Mr. Rose called Mr. Musk\u2019s demand \u201ccurious and ill-timed,\u201d considering that Tesla faces increasing competition and difficult economic conditions.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Tesla\u2019s success under Mr. Musk forced traditional carmakers to begin offering electric vehicles, which are essential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation. But Mr. Musk\u2019s behavior and statements have weighed on the share price and gotten him into trouble with regulators.Tesla shares fell when Mr. Musk sold some of his stake to buy Twitter. The shares also suffered after Mr. Musk said in 2018 that he had the money to take Tesla private and delist it from the stock exchange. Mr. Musk was unable to execute the plan. The going-private statement led to a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which Tesla settled for $40 million while agreeing that lawyers would screen what Mr. Musk\u2019s says on Twitter. It was not clear whether Mr. Musk\u2019s statement on X late Monday had been approved by lawyers.It would be difficult for Tesla\u2019s board, which has been criticized for not doing enough to control Mr. Musk, to grant his wish immediately or unconditionally. The company would have to issue new shares, Mr. Rose of Battle Research said. That would dilute the value of existing shares without raising additional capital for Tesla, and might spawn shareholder lawsuits.But Mr. Rose added that the board could assign Mr. Musk stock options that he would receive only if he achieves certain milestones over five years or more. That would be similar to a compensation package Mr. Musk received in 2018 that depended on Tesla reaching stock market valuations seen at the time as unrealistically ambitious. Mr. Musk became the world\u2019s richest man by defying expectations and hitting the targets.\nThe company\u2019s stock has fallen about 11 percent so far this year but is up about 70 percent over the last 12 months.Mr. Musk did not specify which products he might develop outside the company. He has already started a separate artificial intelligence business called X.AI, which last year released the Grok chatbot to selected users even though he has also highlighted the hazards of the technology in public comments.Tesla\u2019s main use of artificial intelligence has come in its Autopilot and Full Self Driving systems, which assist drivers by taking over certain tasks in certain driving situations. Mr. Musk has said several times over the years that the company was close to perfecting the technology that would allow a car to drive itself completely. But self-driving technology has taken longer to perfect than Mr. Musk\u2019s predictions, and many experts believe it is still years away.The carmaker has also been working on a robot it calls Optimus. The device can fold a shirt, according to a video posted on X by Tesla on Monday, but has not become a significant source of revenue.On X, some of Mr. Musk\u2019s fans applauded his demand for a 25 percent stake, saying he earned the money. But others said it was his own fault his stake in the company has fallen. \u201cThey didn\u2019t make you sell your shares,\u201d one user wrote, adding, \u201cwhy should the board do anything to rectify this for you?\u201d\nA stake of less than 15 percent of the company, Mr. Musk said, \u201cmakes a takeover by dubious interests too easy.\u201d",

	"text": "Spirit Airlines, once a fast-growing low-cost carrier, is struggling to convince investors that it has a clear path forward after an antitrust ruling blocked the sale of the company to JetBlue Airways.A federal judge in Boston blocked the proposed merger on Tuesday, concurring with the Justice Department that the deal would hurt consumers by reducing their choices and raising fares. The airlines announced late Friday that they had jointly filed a notice of appeal.Before it struck a deal with JetBlue in July 2022, Spirit was struggling. Unlike larger airlines, it never fully recovered from the early days of the pandemic in 2020. The budget airline is losing money, and some analysts say it is hard to see how Spirit can dig itself out of its financial hole without finding another buyer. Some airline experts say the carrier might have to file for bankruptcy protection.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a challenging financial picture for the company,\u201d said Xavier Smith, director of energy and industrials research at AlphaSense.\nIn the days since the ruling, Spirit\u2019s stock has lost more than half its value. In a regulatory filing Friday morning, Spirit said it would seek to refinance a large chunk of its debt that comes due in September 2025. It said the merger agreement with JetBlue \u201cremains in full force and effect.\u201d The company\u2019s shares climbed 17 percent in Friday\u2019s session after that announcement and rallied more in extended trading after the appeal was announced.On Thursday, the shares plunged sharply after The Wall Street Journal reported that Spirit was exploring restructuring options. Asked about that report, the company said it was \u201cnot pursuing nor involved in a statutory restructuring.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Spirit, like other airlines, took out loads of debt during the pandemic, but it has not had the financial rebound that bigger carriers have seen. It now owes about $6.6 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2019.This month, the company sold and leased back 25 jets, which allowed it to reduce its debt by $465 million.\n\u201cSpirit has been taking, and will continue to take, prudent steps to ensure the strength of its balance sheet and ongoing operations,\u201d the company said in a statement on Thursday.Unlike larger carriers like Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, Spirit flies mostly within the United States; its few international routes are relatively short. As a result, it has not managed the strong profits that many bigger airlines have been making on flights to Europe or Asia, and it is more exposed to fierce price wars on U.S. routes.In addition, Spirit\u2019s expenses have increased more than 60 percent since 2019 because of higher wages for pilots and flight attendants and pricier jet fuel.The airline is also struggling because of problems with Pratt & Whitney engines on some of its planes. Spirit grounded 26 of its nearly 200 jets after the supplier disclosed manufacturing defects.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.If the appeal by the two carriers fails, analysts say there are two likely outcomes for Spirit: Another airline could acquire it, or the company could use a bankruptcy filing to restructure its debt or sell its assets.\nSpirit at its current valuation may be an attractive option for an airline looking to expand. Buying another airline is often the easiest and most efficient way to grow because there are few or no gates available at popular airports. Planes are also in short supply because the two main manufacturers \u2014 Airbus and Boeing \u2014 have a backlog of orders that stretches out for as much as five years.Frontier Airlines, which proposed buying Spirit before JetBlue outbid it, or another low-cost carrier would most likely have the easiest time winning antitrust approval, said Dylan Carson, a lawyer at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips.\u201cThat, I think, has the potential to secure the blessing of antitrust enforcers,\u201d said Mr. Carson, a former Justice Department antitrust attorney.Frontier\u2019s cash-and-stock deal with Spirit was worth about $2.8 billion, compared with the $3.8 billion that JetBlue was willing to pay. Now that Spirit\u2019s valuation has dropped, another airline may be able to strike a deal for a lower price.But Frontier\u2019s share price has also dropped, by more than 60 percent, since it offered to buy Spirit, which may pose a challenge for another bid. Frontier planned to use stock to pay for part of the earlier deal. A representative for Frontier declined to comment on whether it would consider another offer for Spirit.\nOf course, Sprit\u2019s fortunes could improve if demand for domestic air travel grows significantly, though most analysts don\u2019t expect that to happen anytime soon.Spirit is known for its no-frills experience. It packs more seats into its planes than other airlines, leaving passengers with less legroom. The company charges fees for carry-on bags, which are included in other airlines. Because many of its customers fly it to save money, Spirit has a limited ability to raise fares.Kerry Tan, a professor at Loyola University Maryland who has studied airline fares, said that when Spirit offered service on a particular route, its competitors were forced to lower their prices.\u201cIn my eyes, the worst-case scenario is that Spirit disappears and we\u2019re left with a less competitive environment,\u201d Dr. Tan said.Judge William G. Young said in his ruling this week that if the proposed merger went through, JetBlue would absorb an airline that charged very low prices, significantly shrinking the category of such airlines and raising fares.\n\u201cSpirit is a small airline,\u201d he said in the ruling. \u201cBut there are those who love it. To those dedicated customers of Spirit, this one\u2019s for you.\u201dMadison Lee, a budget travel blogger, is one of those people.She said Spirit\u2019s cheap flights and influence on other airlines\u2019 prices gave Americans \u201can equal opportunity to travel.\u201d Ms. Lee, 25, has been to 60 countries, mostly using budget airlines.\u201cIt may not come with all the bells and whistles, you might not feel as comfortable, but honestly, a lot of people, their purpose for travel isn\u2019t necessarily to be comfortable,\u201d she said. \u201cSpirit gets the job done.\u201d",

	"text": "It is impossible even to talk about the long bull market that ended in January 2022 without saying high-growth tech stocks propelled the market higher.Companies like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla dominated the headlines for years. Tech stocks and growth stocks were virtually synonymous. But not anymore.The new growth stocks, in the estimation of S&P Dow Jones Indices, an influential market analysis firm, now include fossil-fuel energy companies.The world has changed radically in the last year or two, and traditional categories, like growth and value, are topsy-turvy.\nS&P Dow Jones Indices handles the plumbing behind the two most famous American stock market indexes \u2014 the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average \u2014 and many other important world market benchmarks.In an annual review of the S&P 500 index, it has found that the seemingly immutable connections between tech and growth, and between energy and value, in the stock market have weakened, if not snapped entirely.The FindingsInvestors have often viewed growth and value stocks as two essential categories. Basically, growth stocks promise a lot in the future but deliver less right now. Value stocks, on the other hand, aren\u2019t usually trendy. They are priced well below what their advocates consider to be their real worth.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But which stocks belong in each category? The answer seemed obvious, until the stock market collapsed in 2022. The prices of tech companies were shriveling, and they pulled the entire market down.Now, using strictly mathematical measures, S&P Dow Jones Indices has found that Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft are no longer \u201cpure growth\u201d stocks. They have been replaced in the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index by an unlikely group: fossil-fuel companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron.\nThese conclusions are a startling sign of how much the world and its financial markets have been battered in the last year or two.Until the S&P Indices findings, for example, Exxon and Chevron had been almost universally classified as value stocks. In the thinking that prevailed a couple of years ago, an urgent need to address global warming impaired the long-term viability of fossil fuel companies. Even among investors who favored their shares, these firms were presumed to be a good value precisely because they were so unfashionable. Last year, at least, those assumptions about growth and value stocks were overturned, along with many other presumptions about the world.The World ChangedRussia\u2019s yearlong war in Ukraine set off a series of unanticipated shocks that elevated world oil and gas prices. Energy prices have come down a bit, but still remain high.Publicly traded energy companies had outsize gains in sales, profits and stock prices. Exxon and Chevron have both reported record profits for last year. The S&P 500 dropped more than 18 percent in 2022, but energy was the only sector to rise, with an eye-popping total return of almost 67 percent, including dividends. The sector\u2019s sales, price and earnings momentum transformed its biggest components into growth stocks, at least in the backward-looking lens used by S&P 500 Indices.\nAt the same time, the eight big tech companies stumbled, for idiosyncratic reasons, as well as systemic ones. Tesla, for example, faces serious competition in the market for electric vehicles, even as the Twitter escapades of its proprietor, Elon Musk, may be turning off some would-be car buyers. Meta reported a continuing decline in sales and earnings on Wednesday, though its stock soared on plans for further share buybacks, amid a broad stock market rally fueled by hopes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases were abating. Still, the scale of its unprofitable investments in virtual reality have worried many investors. Netflix, which once said it competed only with sleep for the attention of its subscribers, now jousts with a horde of streaming companies.But, in broad terms, two real-world factors are responsible for their reclassification this year. First, while the initial, lockdown phase of the Covid-19 pandemic generally increased tech firms\u2019 sales and profits in 2020 and 2021, it set them up for a sharp decline in their growth rates in 2022 as the economy recovered.Second, soaring inflation and rising interest rates \u2014 the Fed raised short-term rates again on Wednesday \u2014 hurt the tech companies, too. Why? Basically because tech companies that entice investors with the mere promise of future sales and profits are worth less when the costs of waiting for those promises rise.In short, the abrupt reversal of the eight big tech companies\u2019 momentum last year changed their profiles, according to the S&P Indices algorithms. Now, the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index includes just one: Apple. Despite periodic setbacks like the decline in sales and earnings it announced on Thursday, it has for the most part kept growing.How are the others classified? The answer isn\u2019t simple. Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft now reside in both of the two, more inclusive, S&P 500 growth and value indexes: subsets of the S&P 500 that welcome stocks near the middle of the growth-value spectrum. Netflix, Nvidia and Tesla are only in the broad growth index, implying that they have retained more growth characteristics than Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Microsoft.\nThe shifts are dizzying. They amount to a wholesale transformation of nearly a third of the market weight of the S&P 500 growth and value indexes. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest turnover since the start of current measurement methods in 2009,\u201d Hamish Preston, director of U.S. Equity for S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview.The ImplicationsIn decision-making, it helps if you know what you\u2019re talking about. But when it comes to growth and value stocks, it\u2019s not easy to know.Growth funds based on the S&P 500 indexes now contain fossil-fuel energy stocks, and if you thought that by holding those funds you were owning tech stocks, you may be disappointed. Funds based on other indexes, like the Russell 1000 Growth index, haven\u2019t yet rebalanced their holdings this year, and they still look more like traditional growth stock funds. Buyer beware.Be careful in evaluating the horse races that have gone on for decades. Depending on the index, a stock that had been a growth champion may suddenly be running under the livery of value. These shifting labels raise questions, to say the least, about the enduring worth of such distinctions. At the level of individual companies, finer distinctions can be made. There is a well-tested, disciplined value-investing approach used in analyzing stocks, one taught by Benjamin Graham at Columbia, and practiced by his star student, Warren Buffett.\nBut unless you make a living with this method, I\u2019d say that this year\u2019s exercise by S&P Indices is invaluable in pointing out the pitfalls of choosing value or growth or any sector in broad bets on the markets. If fossil fuel energy stocks are growth companies in a warming world, what do those words even mean? As an investor, I try to sidestep such judgments entirely. You can do that, too, by owning a piece of the entire stock and bond markets through broad, low-cost index funds that don\u2019t give a greater weight to one style or sector. If you have enough money to pay the bills, just let these investments mature over decades.With that approach, you can observe the ever-changing spectacle of the markets without worrying about their sometimes tenuous relationship with common sense.For my own peace of mind, I don\u2019t worry about shifting growth and value distinctions. I hold the entire market, and get on with other things.",

	"text": "Exchange-traded funds come in many shapes and sizes. Some are plain vanilla, diversified index funds that let you invest in the entire stock and bond markets, and are excellent core holdings for the great majority of people.Then there are the quirky, narrowly focused E.T.F.s like the Inverse Cramer Tracker, which enables you to bet against the stock picks of the CNBC television host Jim Cramer. The fund is legal, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 and a money-loser since its inception last year. Betting against Jim Cramer just isn\u2019t a great investing strategy.Neither is fear of missing out. Yet FOMO is the main reason for putting money into Bitcoin, which remains highly speculative, difficult to categorize and without an immediately identifiable economic function.The S.E.C. this month approved 11 new E.T.F.s that track the price of Bitcoin, and the decision has been heralded by promoters of Bitcoin \u2014 and of the new funds \u2014 as an important event, legitimizing Bitcoin as an asset class.\nI don\u2019t think so.The S.E.C.\u2019s action, in itself, doesn\u2019t give Bitcoin any new stature. It merely adds Bitcoin funds to a long list of E.T.F.s that are perfectly legal and simple to buy, but that don\u2019t belong in anybody\u2019s core portfolio. I\u2019d put the Inverse Cramer Tracker in this category, as well as E.T.F.s that track a single stock like Tesla, PayPal or Nvidia, or that use leverage to triple a bet on energy prices or quadruple one on the S&P 500. I could go on and on.Simply being legal doesn\u2019t make a strategy sensible for most investors. In fact, while approving the Bitcoin E.T.F.s, the agency also issued an explicit warning against FOMO investing in so-called digital assets \u2014 as it has done many times before.\u201cJust because others around you might be buying into these kinds of opportunities, it doesn\u2019t mean you have to,\u201d said Lori Schock, director of the S.E.C.\u2019s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy.The agency\u2019s approval of the new Bitcoin funds does change things in one important sense, though. Until now, it was easy for me to avoid discussing Bitcoin in the context of investing. Why bring attention to something that isn\u2019t right for most people? But now that major financial services companies like BlackRock, Fidelity, Franklin Templeton, Invesco and Wisdom Tree are beginning to operate Bitcoin E.T.F.s, and make them available to their clients, silence seems unnatural and, maybe, irresponsible.So here goes.Making Sense of BitcoinI don\u2019t want to dismiss Bitcoin entirely.Granted, it\u2019s possible to make \u2014 and lose \u2014 a great deal of money buying and selling it. And Bitcoin is a serious proposition, in terms of its underlying structure. The use of blockchain, the decentralized, peer-to-peer structure and the complex mathematical code demand respect. Concepts embedded in Bitcoin and other so-called cryptocurrencies could have real-world importance at some point, and in some way, though perhaps not as Bitcoin.\nAs Bryan Armour, who directs research into strategies based on index funds at Morningstar, told me, \u201cNot believing that Bitcoin E.T.F.s are a good investment doesn\u2019t mean that blockchain isn\u2019t a good or useful technology.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But Bitcoin itself? He put it politely. \u201cI\u2019d say Bitcoin is still in the price discovery stage. We\u2019re still trying to figure out what it might be worth.\u201dFor large corporations or other big institutional investors interested in getting some Bitcoin exposure, the new E.T.F.s may be a better and more convenient option, said Samara Cohen, chief investment officer of E.T.F. and index investments at BlackRock. \u201cIt\u2019s the start of a journey,\u201d she said.But for ordinary people investing for important things like retirement or a house or a child\u2019s education, I\u2019d be very careful. The collapse of the FTX trading platform in 2022 and the fraud and conspiracy conviction of Sam Bankman-Fried only a few months ago are reminders that Bitcoin is extremely risky. Its future is uncertain, and so is its very definition.Defining TermsJust to start, I find the term cryptocurrency to be a misnomer. These things aren\u2019t currencies because they can\u2019t be widely exchanged for products and services in the real world. But even if they were currencies, it wouldn\u2019t make sense for ordinary people to invest in them. Major corporations hedge against fluctuations in currency values, but most of us invest in assets that at least have the potential of producing income and cash flow \u2014 assets that can be purchased with currency. \nThen we get to the central claim for the new E.T.F.s \u2014 that they are helping to create \u201can asset class,\u201d one that \u201cprotects you\u201d in times of uncertainty, much as gold did \u201cfor thousands of years,\u201d in the words of Laurence D. Fink, the chairman of BlackRock. This comparison, I think, is strained.Gold has a historical cachet, has actually served as money, is still held by central banks, has commercial uses in jewelry and industry and has an important cultural role in countries like India. Bitcoin has none of those attributes.But in one sense I agree with the comparison. Gold is not an important part of a modern diversified investment portfolio, which contains stocks, bonds and cash.Small amounts of gold may not hurt you much, but they won\u2019t help much either, numerous studies have shown. The stock market has done better over the long run than gold as an inflation hedge. Nobody needs gold as an investment now.That\u2019s true of Bitcoin, too, which, in its brief life since its inception during the financial crisis of 2008-9, has not been an effective inflation hedge.\nBut it\u2019s different from gold. Bitcoin has added considerable risk to the portfolios of those who have held it.A Morningstar study last year by Madeline Hume found that as little as a 2 percent holding of Bitcoin can transform a conservative stock-bond portfolio into a far riskier one. Investors may be tempted by Bitcoin when its price is rising, but beware: \u201cCompared with other assets, though, Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is more kerosene than kindling,\u201d the report said.Already ExposedIn a very small way, even without the new E.T.F.s, there\u2019s a good chance that you already have exposure to Bitcoin in your portfolio.Most of the new E.T.F.s rely on Coinbase, which calls itself \u201ca trusted and easy-to-use platform for accessing the broader cryptoeconomy,\u201d for important functions: converting cash into Bitcoin and Bitcoin into cash, storage and safekeeping of Bitcoin, assistance in monitoring the fund\u2019s operations and sometimes all of these.Coinbase is a publicly traded company, and the largest holders of most such companies are mutual funds and E.T.F.s run by giants like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street and Fidelity. I checked: My Vanguard workplace retirement accounts include broad, diversified stock index funds that hold Coinbase.\nAnd that\u2019s not all. They also include small shares of companies like MicroStrategy, which owns a lot of Bitcoin. Then there are firms like Riot Platforms and CleanSpark that call themselves \u201cBitcoin miners\u201d \u2014 entities that run the computers that generate new Bitcoin and keep the Bitcoin universe spinning.I don\u2019t see a great social purpose for Bitcoin mining. A 2022 White House report said global electricity consumption for \u201ccrypto assets\u201d was greater than \u201cthe total annual electricity usage of many individual countries, such as Argentina or Australia.\u201d That\u2019s hard to justify in an age of global warming.I\u2019m not happy about this, but I have a stake in them, and you probably do, too. That\u2019s the way index fund investing goes. You hold part of the entire universe of publicly traded companies. On the positive side, if it turns out that I\u2019m wrong about Bitcoin, and that it really is the next big thing \u2014 and, somehow, is needed to save the planet \u2014 well, these companies will grow in size, and my portfolio will swell, too. That would be a win-win, though I\u2019m not counting on it.Vanguard, I should point out, has taken a principled stand against Bitcoin. Its broad index funds own the companies involved with crypto because those funds own all companies. But if you want to buy the new Bitcoin E.T.F.s \u2014 or, as of Jan. 12, older ones that tracked Bitcoin futures markets \u2014 you can\u2019t do it at Vanguard.In an email, Karyn Baldwin, a spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe also have no plans to offer Vanguard Bitcoin E.T.F.s or other crypto-related products.\u201d Instead, she said, Vanguard is \u201cfocused on asset classes such as equities, bonds, and cash, which Vanguard views as the building blocks of a well-balanced, long-term investment portfolio.\u201d\nThat makes sense to me. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are not a legitimate asset class, at least not yet. Publicly traded Bitcoin companies are. I can live with that oddity.In short, although the new E.T.F.s may help the companies involved with them and may well cause interest in Bitcoin to grow, Bitcoin still isn\u2019t important for serious individual investors.Nothing the S.E.C. has done this month has changed that.That doesn\u2019t mean you should avoid Bitcoin. Owning some might be fun and profitable. But I\u2019d make the same statement about buying lottery tickets, spending evenings at a casino, making online bets on your favorite sports team \u2014 or purchasing shares of the Inverse Cramer Tracker.If you can afford to spend your money on entertainments like these, by all means, enjoy yourself.

	"text": "The wager was supposed to be a no-brainer. China was reopening after nearly three years of pandemic lockdowns, and investors expected that its economy, the world\u2019s second largest, would come roaring back to life. Chinese stocks soared.But that bet has soured. This week, Chinese stocks that are traded in Hong Kong sank briefly into a bear market, after losing more than 20 percent of their value from a high in January. Stocks on the mainland are also in the red for the year.The declines reflect a fizzling optimism in the viability of the post-Covid recovery in China, which has long been a driver of global growth. Despite the continuing geopolitical tensions between China and the United States, the economic and business ties between the two countries remain intricately linked.\u201cAll the signals from China are pointing to a bumpy, faltering economic rebound,\u201d said Tina Teng, an analyst with CMC Markets in Auckland, New Zealand.\nBeijing is contending with weaker-than-expected consumer spending, slowing home sales and a manufacturing sector in flux. A weaker currency is compounding the problems. It remains uncertain what, if any, action the Chinese government might take to support growth.Last year, numerous Covid lockdowns took a heavy toll on China\u2019s economy. It grew 3 percent, a rate that was one of the slowest in decades, well short of Beijing\u2019s own target and slower than that of 2021.\nThe authorities gave the stock market a jolt last fall with stimulus measures designed to support the property sector. Another bump followed in December, with the abrupt end of the strict \u201czero Covid\u201d policy. Stocks entered the new year on an upward trajectory and peaked toward the end of January.In the first three months of the year, China\u2019s economy grew 4.5 percent \u2014 with consumers responsible for the bulk of the gain \u2014 and appeared to be on track for a recovery. Spending has been strong in recent months, notably in the luxury and food and beverage sectors, but increasingly hasn\u2019t met investors\u2019 expectations. A high rate of youth unemployment further darkens the outlook.\nWhile countries in the West contend with inflation, China is flirting with the opposite and potentially more malign force of deflation, or persistently low prices that drag on the economy by dampening company profits and wages.\u201cDomestic demand is still weak,\u201d Ms. Teng said.Consequently, many economists have dialed back their expectations in recent weeks, contributing to the stock market decline. But a number of analysts, including those at the investment banks Nomura and Barclays, still expect China\u2019s gross domestic product this year to increase at a faster rate than the government\u2019s forecast, which calls for 5 percent growth.Projections for the U.S. economy, the world\u2019s largest, are lower, but American stocks are faring much better than China\u2019s. The S&P 500, a broad index of stocks, is up about 12 percent this year.Recent decisions by the Communist Party of China and its top leader, Xi Jinping, have hurt stock market sentiment. A crackdown on consulting and advisory firms with overseas ties has spooked some foreign businesses and investors, reigniting questions about the viability of international firms doing business in China.\n\u201cThe recovery has stalled, due partly to Beijing\u2019s inability to boost confidence among consumers and business investors,\u201d Nomura economists wrote in a report last month. \u201cAs disappointment kicks in, we see a rising risk of a downward spiral, resulting in weaker activity data, rising unemployment, persistent disinflation, falling market interest rates and a weaker currency.\u201d\nBut some observers argue that investors have just misjudged the reopening of the economy in China \u2014 an event that has no historical parallel. And they have missed a shift in how the authorities prioritize national security concerns over economic ones.\u201cThe mentality of the way the Chinese economy is managed is completely different,\u201d said Chris Leung, the chief China economist at DBS Bank. The authorities, he added, are not as likely as they were in the past to respond to a stock market slump by taking aggressive steps to drive up share prices. Policymakers in Beijing are focused more on economic bellwethers like manufacturing. And by those measures, Mr. Leung said, the Chinese economy \u201cis not too out of line.\u201dOn Thursday, a private-sector survey showed that factory activity in China had picked up in May, in contrast to official data released a day earlier that showed manufacturing had continued to contract. The mixed signals have broader implications, because manufacturing in China is closely linked to its exports, which, in turn, are an indicator of global demand. A sustained increase in manufacturing would help bump up China\u2019s employment rate, its consumer spending and, eventually, its stock market.For now, investors continue to offload Chinese stocks. The biggest losers this year include the online retailer JD.com and the hot pot chain Haidilao, both down over 20 percent this year. That helped push down Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index to the lowest closing level of the year on Thursday. After a rally on Friday, the index is about 17 percent lower than its high in January. The CSI 300 Index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, is down about 8 percent since peaking in January.\nThe real estate sector continues to be a source of anguish for investors. Property sales from the 100 biggest firms fell about 14 percent in May from the previous month, according to data released this week by China Real Estate Information Corporation.China\u2019s housing problems \u2014 developers that are deep in debt and borrowers who are left with half-finished apartments \u2014 have led to expectations that the Chinese central bank will feel compelled to cut rates this year.Both Nomura and Barclays forecast that China will post significantly higher economic growth \u2014 of almost 8 percent \u2014 in the three months ending in June. Growth for the next two quarters of the year will then moderate toward levels seen earlier this year, according to both projections.Along the way, analysts expect stock market performance to improve. \u201cExcessive pessimism usually corrects itself,\u201d Mr. Leung said.",

	"text": "The stock market has been strutting into the spotlight lately, with talk \u2014 however premature \u2014 of a new A.I.-driven bull market popping up nearly everywhere you turn.Amid all the hoopla, you can easily miss the solid returns being posted by far less glamorous but always important and, at the moment, compelling asset classes: fixed-income investments, including bonds and cash.Especially for those with short time horizons \u2014 whether you\u2019re in retirement or close to it, or saving for a house, education, a car, a vacation or any other worthwhile purpose \u2014 these lower-risk investments are worth a close look.Until a little over a year ago, when interest rates were about as low as they could go, a mantra on Wall Street was TINA. It\u2019s an acronym for \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d to the stock market, certainly not from fixed-income investments.\nNow, though, it\u2019s a different world: Interest rates, or yields, have risen significantly. That\u2019s bad if you\u2019re borrowing, but if you have money to invest or stash somewhere safe so you can pay your bills, there are plenty of appealing options.It is debatable whether it\u2019s wise to lock in higher interest rates now, or stick with shorter-term holdings until it\u2019s clear that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. But the time to appreciate the benefits of fixed-income holdings like money market funds and Treasury bills is already here.Even if you are just starting out in your first job, it\u2019s a good idea to try to keep an emergency fund in short-term, interest-bearing accounts. That\u2019s also true if you have reached a time of life when drawing down your assets, and making them last, are your main concerns. For the moment, it\u2019s possible to get safe returns that are beating inflation.But Stocks Are BoomingStill, the returns on short-term fixed-income investments are likely to be in the mid-single digits, at best. That\u2019s not going to make you rich. But a winning stock could.There have been some rough patches in the stock market. Even so, the returns of big tech stocks so far have been fabulous. Nvidia, which churns out some of the chips that make A.I. run, was up almost 190 percent for the calendar year as of Thursday. Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft were all up more than 35 percent; Meta (Facebook) and Tesla gained more than 100 percent. Wow.\nBut for high-flying tech stocks like these, timing is everything. Many are still down from the market\u2019s peak on Jan. 3, 2022. So is the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is why I\u2019m not confident this is a bull market for stocks, at least not quite yet.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.I\u2019m waiting for the S&P 500 to attain its old lofty level before giving it the bull market designation. And even if the market reaches that pinnacle, I don\u2019t expect to be increasing my personal allocation to stocks.Why? Two big reasons.First, I never reduced that allocation when stocks were falling. I held on then because I couldn\u2019t predict where the market was going. (Wall Street prognosticators can\u2019t do it reliably either, as a long history of failed forecasts shows.)I\u2019m a permanent investor in both stocks and bonds. There\u2019s no need to increase the stock proportion of my portfolio now.Second, I\u2019m not entirely happy about putting money into companies that aren\u2019t producing profits sufficient to justify the investment. Take Nvidia. Its shares have lifted the returns of the S&P 500, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s trading at a lofty price. Its price-to-earnings ratio, which compares price to profits, is now uncomfortably high \u2014 about 10 times that of the S&P 500, according to FactSet data. \nEssentially, Nvidia profits will need to soar for many years to justify the company\u2019s price. Perhaps artificial intelligence will make that happen. I\u2019m not counting on that, though.So I\u2019m hanging in without great enthusiasm. History suggests that the overall stock market will rise over the long haul, but doesn\u2019t tell us anything about what will happen next month or next week, and it doesn\u2019t help much in deciding whether particular companies are worth owning. I\u2019ll hold the entire market through index funds but I\u2019m not eager to take extra risks with my hard-earned money.That\u2019s where bonds and cash come in. They provide solid income with much less risk than stocks \u2014 in theory, anyway.The Effects of Higher YieldsIt didn\u2019t work out well for bonds last year.At the start of the year, money market funds offered virtually no interest and bond returns ranged from mediocre to terrible, depending on the month. Stocks were said to be the only game in town.Interest rates rose as the Federal Reserve battled inflation, and the bond market cratered. Because yields (interest rates) and prices move in opposite directions, and yields started off at rock-bottom levels, soaring interest rates led to the greatest bond market losses of the last century. The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, a benchmark for investment-grade bonds, lost 15 percent in 2022, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 was even worse, with a 20 percent decline, though that was scant consolation if you held a lot of bonds, or bond funds, that you thought were safe.\nNow, it\u2019s a different landscape.Bonds are more reliable than they were last year because yields are already high. Even if they elevate further, there is a plush cushion now, and any potential price declines should be offset, and then some, by the income that bonds are generating. Bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds aren\u2019t likely to experience declines in last year\u2019s range either. \u201cBond math tells us it won\u2019t happen,\u201d Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said in an interview.With the federal funds rate above 5 percent, rich yield has spilled into money market funds and Treasury bills of up to one year in duration. Now that the debt ceiling battle is behind us, and the Treasury is issuing a huge amount of fresh debt, it\u2019s fair to say, once again, that those investments are safe. You can\u2019t make that claim about tech stocks.There are many ways of comparing the valuation of the stock and bond markets.It\u2019s a little wonky.Basically, the higher the bond yields and the lower the stock earnings, the better bonds stack up, and vice versa. One longstanding metric involves comparing the trailing 12-month earnings yield of the S&P 500 with the yields of Treasury securities. At the moment, bonds are doing nicely in this horse race.The S&P earnings yield is 4.34 percent, according to FactSet, making it lower and, in some respects, less attractive, than the ultrasafe 5 percent-plus yields on one-year Treasuries. Investment-grade corporate bonds are attractive, too. The yields on 10-year Treasuries are lower, well below 4 percent, reducing their appeal.What all this means is that the TINA acronym no longer applies: There are viable alternatives to the stock market right now.\nThese comparisons can go only so far. You aren\u2019t likely to receive double-digit annual returns from high-quality fixed-income investments, while you might in the stock market. But the chances of losing a lot of money in bonds are lower, too.A No-BrainerWith yields above 5 percent, money market funds have a powerful allure. They have been pulling in funds, with total money-market assets in the United States exceeding $5.8 trillion in June, according to Crane Data. Interest rates offered by the nation\u2019s banks are rising, too, but generally trail those of money market funds. The question, for opportunistic fixed-income investors, is whether it\u2019s time to lock in higher yields by holding bonds with durations of 10 or more years. I\u2019m not sure that it is.The Federal Reserve has already told investors that short-term interest rates are likely to rise half a percent further this year. Rising yields would hurt the prices of current long-term bonds, as a matter of basic bond math.On the other hand, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening could set off a recession, which, in turn, would be expected to lead to lower yields and higher prices for bonds.\nThis quandary makes the timing of fixed-income \u2014 as well as stock \u2014 investments tricky.Ms. Jones suggests taking a \u201cbarbell approach,\u201d with much of your investment in very short-term holdings and some of it in five-year bonds, either Treasuries or highly rated investment grade corporates. (A three-year Apple bond has a yield with more than a quarter percentage point premium over three-year Treasury notes, according to FactSet.)I hold bonds mainly through broad index funds, just as I do stocks, owning a piece of thousands of securities throughout the United States and the rest of the world. How much in stock and how much in bonds \u2014 and in short-term holdings like money market funds or high-yield savings accounts \u2014 is a matter of personal preference. I don\u2019t alter my approach much, if at all, because of market shifts.The only real change in my financial life in recent years is that I moved much of my emergency money from bank accounts to money market funds because of superior yields. But with inflation above 4 percent, I try not to kid myself. Even at today\u2019s interest rates, money market funds are barely keeping ahead of rising prices. That\u2019s why I keep putting money in the stock market.But money market funds and savings accounts and, to a lesser extent, bonds, all serve a critical purpose. The money should be waiting, ready for use, even when the stock market is rocky.",

	"text": "Stocks on Wall Street pushed further into bull market territory on Tuesday, climbing after new data showed inflation continues to slow.The Consumer Price Index for May was initially read by investors as moderate enough to ensure the Federal Reserve will hold off on another interest rate increase this week. The central bank will announce its decision on Wednesday.The S&P 500-stock index rose 0.7 percent on Tuesday, to its highest level since January of 2022, extending a strong rally since the index fell to a low point in October. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 20 percent from that 2022 low, a gain that by one definition breaches the threshold for a bull market, a marker of a new phase of exuberance in the markets.Slowing inflation is seen by investors and economists as limiting the need for the Federal Reserve to keep increasing interest rates, with increases so far having raised borrowing costs for consumers and companies and weighed on the broader stock market. Some policymakers had already suggested the Fed might not raise rates again this month, and after the latest inflation data, the likelihood of an increase was close to wiped out in markets.\nNot all investors agree on the best way to define a bull market, especially when concerns over the longer-term trajectory of the U.S. economy remain. The S&P 500 is still roughly 9 percent off its record high, reached at the start of 2022, just before fears of rising interest rates in response to accelerating inflation set in and dragged the index to a loss of around 20 percent.\u201cWith inflation stubbornly high, we do see the business cycle eventually ending in recession,\u201d noted Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, deputy chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.Investor exuberance is nonetheless spreading. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies in the United States that are more exposed to the domestic economy, has rallied more than 8 percent this month, and jumped more than 1 percent in response to the inflation report.The index had trended sideways for much of the year, and even after its rally, it remains less than 15 percent above a low reached 12 months ago.However, the Russell 2000\u2019s recent rise is still indicative of the rally taking hold across the stock market as inflation cools and the economy has remained resilient to the potentially damaging effects higher interest rates can bring.\n\u201cWe are just over two weeks away from the beginning of the third quarter. This is meaningful because to start the year there was a near consensus view that this is when the recession would begin,\u201d said Ms. Wilson-Elizondo. \u201cToday, the recession has not arrived.\u201d",

	"text": "About three weeks ago, at a meeting chaired by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, officials acknowledged that China\u2019s economy was facing \u201cnew difficulties and challenges.\u201dAccording to the official Xinhua News Agency\u2019s summary of the Politburo meeting, officials promised to juice the economy, which had started to rebound at the start of the year after Covid restrictions were lifted but had been struggling. The economic troubles, they said, arose from flagging domestic demand and a \u201cgrim and complex\u201d global economy, among other factors.Chinese stocks jumped at the time, even though officials laid out only vague plans, like using \u201ccountercyclical\u201d regulations, adjusting policies for the troubled real estate sector, and prodding people to buy cars, electronics and household goods.Since then, China has released a string of worrying economic data. Prices consumers and business pay are falling, raising the threat of deflation. Retail sales and industrial production in July missed economists\u2019 expectations, and investment in real estate is plunging.\nAs a result, the stock market has lost its fizz.An index of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong has fallen more than 9 percent this month. The benchmark for stocks that trade in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index, is down a similar amount. Among its members, the laggard is the beleaguered Chinese real estate firm Country Garden, which has lost about half its value this month.A stock index called the CSI 300, which tracks the biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, has dropped about 5 percent.\u201cThe Chinese economy is faced with an imminent downward spiral with the worst yet to come,\u201d analysts at the investment bank Nomura wrote in a report on Tuesday. \u201cBeijing should play the role of lender of last resort to support some major developers and financial institutions in trouble, and should play the role of spender of last resort to boost aggregate demand.\u201dIndeed, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the nation\u2019s central bank, has cut key interest rates to new lows. But critics say that the moves have not been bold enough. Wednesday brought more distressing data: Home prices had fallen in 49 of 70 major cities in the country.The central bank, analysts at Barclays said on Tuesday, would soon lower the amount of reserves banks need to hold, in a bid to stimulate the economy. Barclays cut its forecast for economic growth in China this year to 4.5 percent, from 4.9 percent. Next year would bring even slower growth, the analysts said, with output expanding at 4 percent.\nThe Barclays analysts said that the two biggest issues Beijing needed to address were the housing market and domestic spending, which has been hampered by rising unemployment, particularly among young people. On Tuesday, China said it would stop releasing data on youth unemployment, which was at a record high of 21.3 percent.\u201cThe real estate sector remains a big drag on the economic recovery,\u201d the analysts wrote, adding that a bounce in domestic demand had \u201cstalled amid rising unemployment.\u201dClaire Fu contributed reporting.",

It was followed closely by Meta, the Facebook owner, which has been promoting its own A.I. prowess. Tesla, the electric vehicle champion, wasn\u2019t far behind.But what were cruise ships doing near the very pinnacle of the stock market listings?At midyear, three of the big cruise companies \u2014 Carnival, Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings \u2014 were among the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500.Consider that only three years ago, in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, all cruise lines suspended operations and that in the ensuing months, the shares of publicly traded cruise companies were devastated.\nNow, with fears of contagion ebbing and pent-up demand for pleasure trips being unleashed, cruise lines have had a remarkable change of fortune.Inconsistent Returns\nEach of the cruise line stocks had astonishing gains for the first six months of the year, but they are still down significantly from the start of 2020.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Here are their returns, according to FactSet:Carnival, up 134 percent for the first six months of 2023 but down 63 percent since the start of 2020.Royal Caribbean Group, up 110 percent in the first half of 2023 but down 22 percent since 2020.Norwegian Cruise Line, up 78 percent in the first half of 2023 but down 63 percent since 2020.Returns like these might be puzzling if you were unaware of what happened on the planet in the last three years. But factor in the pandemic and the subsequent economic recovery, and the cruise line stock and bond performance tracks nicely.It\u2019s part of a larger pattern.Just as cruise lines have begun to come into their own, a series of companies that prospered during the pandemic are laggards now. Peloton, Zoom and Etsy are trailing in this year\u2019s stock market performance derby. And major pharmaceutical companies, like Moderna and Pfizer, whose shares took off when the firms were providing scarce and desperately needed vaccines against Covid-19, are among the poorest performers in the S&P 500.\nThe PandemicBriefly put, it wasn\u2019t until December 2019 that the first reports of the emergence of a novel coronavirus began to emanate out of China \u2014 and in March 2020 that the World Health Organization declared that a pandemic was underway. In January, cruise lines began canceling port calls in China.In January 2020, the Diamond Princess, a luxury ship owned by Carnival, began an ill-fated journey in Yokohama, Japan. More than 3,700 passengers and crew members were stranded on board for weeks, with little information about the pandemic.But the virus spread relentlessly, and more than 700 people ultimately tested positive. In those early days of the pandemic, when people lacked natural immunity against the disease, and effective treatment and vaccines were not yet widely available, nine passengers died.All major cruise lines suspended operations, as passengers canceled their bookings en masse. It became evident that a cruise ship wasn\u2019t an ideal place to be in the middle of a pandemic.In the stock market, cruise line shares plummeted as 2020 wore on. In that pandemic year, Carnival fell 57 percent, Royal Caribbean 44 percent, and Norwegian 56 percent. The companies had virtually no revenue and mounting debt, and their ability to remain going concerns was in doubt. They survived by taking on enormous debt loads and paying sky-high junk-bond yields, which were needed to attract investors.\nThe joyful atmosphere needed for a successful vacation at sea seemed unattainable.An Incipient RecoveryIt was only in 2022 that their finances \u2014 and share prices \u2014 stabilized, and only this year that they have begun to report sufficient earnings and cash flow to show signs of paring down their debt and returning to steady profit-making operations. In a conversation with stock analysts after reporting earnings in late June, Josh Weinstein, the chief executive of Carnival, said the company\u2019s business volume was approaching 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic and, in some metrics, beginning to exceed it.According to a transcript of the same session, David Bernstein, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said Carnival was pouring cash into debt reduction, \u201cdriving more than $8 billion in total debt reduction through 2026,\u201d down from a $35 billion peak early in 2023.These debt payments, combined with increased revenues, should enable the company to \u201capproach investment grade\u201d in its bond ratings in 2026, Mr. Bernstein said. Because of Carnival\u2019s improving financial picture, the yields on the company\u2019s debt have been declining and the price of its bonds, which move in the opposite direction, have risen.The specifics of each company matter, of course. What the cruise lines have in common is that all have heightened safety procedures aimed at stemming the spread of any future outbreaks on board, commissioned new ships, taken measures to cut costs and embarked on fresh marketing campaigns. Wall Street analysts, including those at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Jefferies, have given them high grades and helped to drive up their share prices.Perhaps the magic of sea cruises is back. Certainly no one needs a recurrence of the dismal events of 2020.\nIn prepandemic times, I took a couple of lovely cruises. On one trip, three generations of my extended family were able to see the world together, while participating separately in age-appropriate recreation \u2014 on board, in the water and on land. So I\u2019m personally pleased by the beginnings of a sea cruise renaissance, though not ready to sail again quite yet.As an investor, I see the stock performance of the cruise lines this year less as a question of whether this is an opportune time to buy their shares and more as an affirmation of the ever-present need to diversify. What may seem safe today could easily become hazardous tomorrow.Harry Markowitz, a Nobel laureate in economics who died last month, transformed modern investing with his teachings about how rigorous diversification can reduce risk. A decade ago, during a volatile stretch in the stock market, he told me that ordinary investors would be better off if they forgot about individual stocks and bought broad low-cost stock and bond index funds instead.Allocate them in a proportion that makes you comfortable, and then devote yourself to more pleasant pursuits. Mr. Markowitz convinced me. As for pleasant pursuits, go with what delights you.That could even be a sea cruise, if you find them fun and, at this stage, safe enough for a carefree voyage.",

	"text": "Regional bank stocks, some of which lost nearly half their value on Monday, rebounded in early trading on Tuesday, helping Wall Street to recover and offering a pause in the market panic over the health of the financial system.The S&P 500 rose 1.5 percent in morning trading, recouping some of its losses from the rapid collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, and pointing to a semblance of stability returning to financial markets. Investors appeared to take to heart assurances that depositors will be protected by federal authorities, helping to calm nerves in the banking sector.First Republic Bank, one of the banks most in the crosshairs of investors in recent days, was up nearly 50 percent, having fallen by a similar amount on Monday. Western Alliance Bancorp rose roughly 40 percent, following a fall of nearly 50 percent. The KBW Bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 banks, rose over 4 percent, its best day in roughly four months.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The rally brushed off inflation data that showed prices continue to rise at a stubbornly high pace. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation cooling slightly for the year through February, but accelerating from the previous month.\nTypically that would garner a strong response from the Federal Reserve, resulting in even higher interest rates that typically weigh on the stock market. But expectations for further rate increases have been moderated by the banking crisis, leaving the Fed in a difficult spot. The central bank has said that it will keep raising interest rates until it has inflation under control but it is those same interest rate increases that were at the root of the pain among banks over the past week.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cPeople are trying to gauge what the Fed is actually going to do given all the new information since the end of last week,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. \u201cI think there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The Fed really has a dilemma on its hands here.\u201dSome investors posited that the crisis in the banking sector appeared contained, boosting sentiment, yet it might still be enough to give the Fed reason to forgo further interest rate increases, bolstering that positive sentiment.Investors\u2019 bets on whether or not the Fed will raise interest rates next week tilted back to expecting a quarter point increase following the hot inflation data, but that\u2019s still markedly lower than where expectations stood a week ago.\u201cThis is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, after the data was released. \u201cAbsent further deterioration in regional banks I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess.\u201d\nIn the bond market, sentiment appeared less hopeful. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, rose by more than 0.3 percentage points \u2014 a large move for an asset that typically rises and falls in tiny fractions of a percentage point. The 10-year Treasury yield remained more anchored, suggesting fading hopes for economic growth over the long term.\u201cI think what is reflected in the bond market is an elevated risk of recession and a credit crunch but for whatever reason it hasn\u2019t reached stock investors yet,\u201d said Ms. Sonders.",

	"text": "Stocks on Wall Street skidded lower in late trading on Wednesday, as investors balked at the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to raise interest rates, by a quarter of a percentage point, amid a banking crisis.The S&P 500 initially jumped after the decision was announced, before falling sharply toward the end of trading, finishing 1.65 percent lower for the day. Trading had been muted in the morning, as investors awaited the Fed\u2019s decision.The ructions in the stock market on Wednesday reflected the challenge facing the Fed: to remain tough on stubborn inflation that has driven up prices for households across America, while acknowledging that its tool for cooling inflation \u2014 raising interest rates \u2014 had helped to lead to the recent bout of ill health among the nation\u2019s banks.The central bank initially appeared to thread the needle, and stock prices jolted higher as its decision was announced. But as trading continued, and the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, answered reporters\u2019 questions, the rally subsided, with some investors left unsatisfied that the central bank chief had done enough to quell concerns about the continued fallout from the bank collapses in recent weeks.\n\u201cThis is the Fed making the same policy error that it has routinely made in its history,\u201d said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer for the wealth manager Mercer Advisors. \u201cI think the Fed is slow to react to significant stress in the banking system.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.In the bond market, the two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rates, fell sharply to below 4 percent, as bets mounted that Wednesday\u2019s interest-rate increase could potentially be the Fed\u2019s last.The Fed has been raising interest rates to restrict the economy and slow inflation. While that was part of the reason for the flare-up in the banking sector, that stress in the financial system could now apply even more pressure on the economy, removing some of the need for the Fed to keep raising interest rates.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cThis is being viewed as either the last, or close to the last, hike,\u201d said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG Securities. \u201cThey were going to be really aggressive on inflation, but the banking crisis has done it for them.\u201dReeling from the series of bank collapses that prompted intervention from regulators around the world and generated violent swings in financial markets, investors, analysts and economists had been left guessing what the Fed might do on Wednesday \u2014 uncertainty that had been reflected in whipsaw trading over the past two weeks.\nTypically, the Fed likes to set investors\u2019 expectations, leading them to the likely outcome of rate decisions, limiting any potential market fallout from a surprise move. But Mr. Powell\u2019s last public comments came just days before regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank, with the Fed chair testifying to Congress that he was open to raising interest rates more quickly in response to data that showed inflation stubbornly embedded within the economy.As the economic backdrop has sharply shifted since Mr. Powell\u2019s comment, investors were left in the dark about what the central bank would do \u2014 stick to earlier plans, or adjust to the new set of circumstances.After a bout of banking turmoil that reverberated around the world, many had begun to believe that the Fed could instead leave rates unchanged.PacWest, a Los Angeles lender that has come under pressure alongside other regional banks, said on Wednesday that it had tapped emergency cash after a 20 percent drop in its deposits since the start of the year.The announcement sent PacWest\u2019s stock price tumbling, down about 17 percent for the day, dragging the share prices of other regional banks lower as well. The moves illustrated the tumultuous backdrop preceding the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates.\u201cI think the Fed is underreacting,\u201d Mr. Calcagni said. \u201cI think there is more stress in the financial system than the Fed thinks.\u201d",

The news sent stock prices sharply higher and Treasury yields plummeting.The S&P 500 rose 1.4 percent after the Fed released its projections for where the economy and interest rates would be by the end of 2024. The rally left it less than 2 percent below the high that was recorded at the start of January 2022, just before fear of higher rates sent the stock market tumbling. The Dow Jones industrial average, viewed as a barometer of the economy because it includes big manufacturing companies that tend to be more sensitive to the economic cycle, also rose 1.4 percent, to a new high.In a positive sign for the broader market, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which also tends to follow the ebb and flow of the domestic economy, rose 3.5 percent.\u201cThe market loves it, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments, after the Fed\u2019s economic projections were released.\nThe Fed\u2019s rapid rate increases since March 2022 have sent shock waves through financial markets, raising borrowing costs on things like mortgages and government debt and weighing on the stock market.On Wednesday, the Fed appeared to confirm something investors have come to expect for a couple of months: Its campaign of raising interest rates is at an end. A sustained slowdown in inflation, bringing it closer to the central bank\u2019s target, has become clearer in recent months. At the same time, continued resilience in the broader economy has meant investors haven\u2019t had to worry as much about the downside of high borrowing costs.Fed officials forecast roughly three rate cuts of a quarter-point each next year, more than they predicted when the Fed met back in September.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, moved abruptly in response to the Fed\u2019s projections, sliding more than a quarter of a percentage point to around 4.4 percent, its biggest one-day decline since the banking crisis in March.Analysts are now split on where the market will go from here. Some caution that with growth waning, and inflation still yet to slow fully to the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent, rate cuts may be needed to prop up the economy, rather than just to adjust to slower inflation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my expectation that we will see growth continue to slow, and if the Fed is cutting, they are cutting a lot and quickly,\u201d said Ms. Goodwin.",

	"text": "\u201cAll investments involve taking on risk.\u201d That\u2019s a standard Securities and Exchange Commission warning.Be careful. But be aware that unless you take on some risk, you won\u2019t get much of a return. This risk-return trade-off is an essential part of investing, even if you have a low threshold for risk.Perhaps you can\u2019t afford to lose money, don\u2019t have enough time to recover from a temporary loss or just can\u2019t stand the very idea of putting your money at risk.If any of this sounds like you, there is some good news. Interest rates are far higher than they were just a couple of years ago, though they have fallen a bit lately. For risk-averse investors, the terms of the classic trade-off have shifted in your favor. Without taking on more short-term risk, you can get better returns.\nStill, fixed-income investments aren\u2019t a panacea. Over the long run, they have returned less than the overall stock market and are likely to do so in the future. Paradoxically, if you overemphasize safety by loading up too heavily on fixed income, you may be giving up a degree of prosperity later. Balancing these issues is what the risk-return trade-off is all about.When Rates Were LowLower interest rates tend to stimulate the economy. They are better for borrowers \u2014 including people who want to take out a mortgage or pay down a credit card, or finance a business. Lower rates also benefit risk-taking investors because the stock market tends to flourish when money is cheap.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But higher rates are better for people who are saving money, including risk-averse investors who have managed to build a nest egg and want to convert it into a safe, rich stream for retirement. To their chagrin, interest rates \u2014 also known as yields \u2014 began dropping in 2007 in the early days of the financial crisis. This meant that if you bought a newly issued security and held it to maturity, you would have received little income in return. It\u2019s only this year, and thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s long battle against inflation, that long-term interest rates have risen back to levels that prevailed before the financial crisis.The effects of shifting yields can be stark for anyone hoping to live off the income stream produced by bonds or annuities.Consider this. A retiree who bought a 10-year Treasury note in January 2000 was able to lock in a yield of 6.68 percent \u2014 generating $6,680 annually on a $100,000 investment for the next decade. But by January 2009, deep into the financial crisis, the yield on a newly purchased 10-year Treasury was only 2.87 percent \u2014 producing a mere $2,870 annually on the same size of an investment.\nThe implications of these low yields for risk-averse investors weren\u2019t widely reported at first, probably because for bond traders \u2014 who are looking for profit, not years of guaranteed income \u2014 falling yields were a good thing.Remember, as part of bond math, yields and prices move in opposite directions. When market yields dropped, people who already owned bonds and sold them benefited from higher prices. Falling yields were also generally helpful for those who owned bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Bond fund returns are determined both by yields \u2014 which were dropping \u2014 and by prices, which rose. For longer-term securities held by funds, the price gains typically outweighed the losses.The Painful PartBut for risk-averse investors seeking stable long-term returns, it\u2019s precisely when yields are low that problems arise. That began to happen more than a decade ago. In a 2013 column, I pointed out that a risk-averse newly retired couple with a $1 million nest egg invested in fixed-income holdings at the time could easily exhaust their holdings within one decade, because their stream of income would be quite low. They would probably improve their prospects, I suggested, if they shifted some investments into the stock market.And, indeed, market returns over the last decade show that assessment was on the mark. The S&P 500, a benchmark for the U.S. stock market, returned nearly 12 percent, annualized, while the investment-grade bond market returned only 1.5 percent.But investing in stocks entails risk. Retirees would have had to have enough resources \u2014 both financial and emotional \u2014 to withstand gut-wrenching declines.\nAnother safe option existed. The couple in 2013 could also have increased their retirement income reasonably safely by buying a cheap, simple annuity \u2014 a single premium immediate annuity (often denoted by its acronym, SPIA) \u2014 to supplement their retirement savings and Social Security payments. In 2013, a $100,000 investment in such an annuity by a 65-year-old would have generated an average $6,348 annual lifetime payout for a man and $5,904 for a woman, the archive of the website immediateannuities.com shows.Both income streams were far higher than the couple would have received from 10-year Treasuries when the 2013 column was written, but lower than the stock market produced.Higher RatesToday, for the risk-averse, the situation is more favorable.A newly purchased 10-year Treasury will produce around $4,250 in annual income on a $100,000 investment \u2014 compared with a mere $640 on a new Treasury note purchased in April 2020.Income from single premium immediate annuities is also much better. In April 2020, when interest rates were low, the annual lifetime payout on a $100,000 investment for a 65-year-old was $5,676 for man and $5,352 for a woman. In November, the payouts had risen to $7,380 for a 65-year-old man and $7,068 for a woman.As a practical matter, bonds offer much more flexibility than annuities, through either buying a series of individual bonds with maturities tailored to your needs or holding an investment-grade bond fund, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\u201cHigher rates are, of course, better for people who want the income that bonds provide,\u201d she said.Total ReturnBut investing only in fixed income isn\u2019t ideal, even for retirees, with the possible exception of those with an expected life span of only a few more years and limited resources. For one thing, even when interest rates are high, inflation will eat away at least some of the income.\u201cYou want to be careful that you don\u2019t succumb to \u2018money illusion,\u2019\u201d said Joel Dickson, global head of advice methodology at Vanguard. \u201cYou can think that you\u2019re doing fine,\u201d he said, but your spending power will decline as prices rise.The stock market tends to outpace inflation over extended periods, and Mr. Dickson and Ms. Jones both said a \u201ctotal return\u201d approach probably made sense for most people, even retirees. This means keeping a well-diversified portfolio of stocks in addition to bonds.Remember there are trade-offs in investing. There\u2019s no one perfect answer for everyone. Yes, higher rates are a boon if you need to lock in income. But the total return from holdings that include stocks is likely to outperform pure fixed-income investments, if you have the time and the stomach to withstand major market downturns.",

	"text": "Stocks rose on Thursday afternoon, after a second day of volatility in which the S&P 500 swung between gains and losses.The index rose 0.3 percent by the end of the day. It had earlier climbed more than 1.7 percent, but gave up that gain before climbing again.The big swings this week have come as investors have wrestled with the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rapid interest-rate increases on the banking system. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, continuing its campaign to dampen inflation. It was the ninth increase in borrowing costs in a year.But the Fed also acknowledged that it may be near the end of its rate-raising cycle, and that turmoil in the banking system, set off by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, could push it to pause. If banks pull back on lending as a result of turbulence in the financial system, making it harder for consumers to borrow and spend, that could dampen inflation by slowing the economy.\nInvestors remain worried about the health of the banking system. The jump in rates over the past year pummeled the value of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s investment portfolio, which started a run on deposits as the bank\u2019s customers feared it could fail. When it did collapse, that raised fears that other banks may also succumb, particularly smaller lenders with less diversified deposit bases.The shakiness of bank balance sheets is one reason many investors are betting that the Fed will stop raising rates, and may even start cutting them later this year. That is despite statements to the contrary by policymakers, who say that the fight against stubbornly high inflation is not finished.\u201cMarkets are, so far, not trusting the ability of the Fed to treat inflation and financial stability independently,\u201d analysts at ING wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cThis looks unlikely to change soon.\u201dThough the concern over small banks has certainly eased somewhat in recent days, trading on Thursday showed that investors are still uneasy: PacWest Bank, Zions Bancorp and First Republic Bank were all lower.On Thursday, central banks in Britain, Norway and Switzerland also raised rates. The Bank of England\u2019s quarter-point increase was its 11th consecutive move higher, and policymakers said that the country\u2019s banking system was able to withstand a period of higher rates.\nShares in London slipped after the decision, with the FTSE 100 down about half a percent.",

	"text": "The stock market has been strutting into the spotlight lately, with talk \u2014 however premature \u2014 of a new A.I.-driven bull market popping up nearly everywhere you turn.Amid all the hoopla, you can easily miss the solid returns being posted by far less glamorous but always important and, at the moment, compelling asset classes: fixed-income investments, including bonds and cash.Especially for those with short time horizons \u2014 whether you\u2019re in retirement or close to it, or saving for a house, education, a car, a vacation or any other worthwhile purpose \u2014 these lower-risk investments are worth a close look.Until a little over a year ago, when interest rates were about as low as they could go, a mantra on Wall Street was TINA. It\u2019s an acronym for \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d to the stock market, certainly not from fixed-income investments.\nNow, though, it\u2019s a different world: Interest rates, or yields, have risen significantly. That\u2019s bad if you\u2019re borrowing, but if you have money to invest or stash somewhere safe so you can pay your bills, there are plenty of appealing options.It is debatable whether it\u2019s wise to lock in higher interest rates now, or stick with shorter-term holdings until it\u2019s clear that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. But the time to appreciate the benefits of fixed-income holdings like money market funds and Treasury bills is already here.Even if you are just starting out in your first job, it\u2019s a good idea to try to keep an emergency fund in short-term, interest-bearing accounts. That\u2019s also true if you have reached a time of life when drawing down your assets, and making them last, are your main concerns. For the moment, it\u2019s possible to get safe returns that are beating inflation.But Stocks Are BoomingStill, the returns on short-term fixed-income investments are likely to be in the mid-single digits, at best. That\u2019s not going to make you rich. But a winning stock could.There have been some rough patches in the stock market. Even so, the returns of big tech stocks so far have been fabulous. Nvidia, which churns out some of the chips that make A.I. run, was up almost 190 percent for the calendar year as of Thursday. Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft were all up more than 35 percent; Meta (Facebook) and Tesla gained more than 100 percent. Wow.\nBut for high-flying tech stocks like these, timing is everything. Many are still down from the market\u2019s peak on Jan. 3, 2022. So is the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is why I\u2019m not confident this is a bull market for stocks, at least not quite yet.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.I\u2019m waiting for the S&P 500 to attain its old lofty level before giving it the bull market designation. And even if the market reaches that pinnacle, I don\u2019t expect to be increasing my personal allocation to stocks.Why? Two big reasons.First, I never reduced that allocation when stocks were falling. I held on then because I couldn\u2019t predict where the market was going. (Wall Street prognosticators can\u2019t do it reliably either, as a long history of failed forecasts shows.)I\u2019m a permanent investor in both stocks and bonds. There\u2019s no need to increase the stock proportion of my portfolio now.Second, I\u2019m not entirely happy about putting money into companies that aren\u2019t producing profits sufficient to justify the investment. Take Nvidia. Its shares have lifted the returns of the S&P 500, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s trading at a lofty price. Its price-to-earnings ratio, which compares price to profits, is now uncomfortably high \u2014 about 10 times that of the S&P 500, according to FactSet data. \nEssentially, Nvidia profits will need to soar for many years to justify the company\u2019s price. Perhaps artificial intelligence will make that happen. I\u2019m not counting on that, though.So I\u2019m hanging in without great enthusiasm. History suggests that the overall stock market will rise over the long haul, but doesn\u2019t tell us anything about what will happen next month or next week, and it doesn\u2019t help much in deciding whether particular companies are worth owning. I\u2019ll hold the entire market through index funds but I\u2019m not eager to take extra risks with my hard-earned money.That\u2019s where bonds and cash come in. They provide solid income with much less risk than stocks \u2014 in theory, anyway.The Effects of Higher YieldsIt didn\u2019t work out well for bonds last year.At the start of the year, money market funds offered virtually no interest and bond returns ranged from mediocre to terrible, depending on the month. Stocks were said to be the only game in town.Interest rates rose as the Federal Reserve battled inflation, and the bond market cratered. Because yields (interest rates) and prices move in opposite directions, and yields started off at rock-bottom levels, soaring interest rates led to the greatest bond market losses of the last century. The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, a benchmark for investment-grade bonds, lost 15 percent in 2022, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 was even worse, with a 20 percent decline, though that was scant consolation if you held a lot of bonds, or bond funds, that you thought were safe.\nNow, it\u2019s a different landscape.Bonds are more reliable than they were last year because yields are already high. Even if they elevate further, there is a plush cushion now, and any potential price declines should be offset, and then some, by the income that bonds are generating. Bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds aren\u2019t likely to experience declines in last year\u2019s range either. \u201cBond math tells us it won\u2019t happen,\u201d Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said in an interview.With the federal funds rate above 5 percent, rich yield has spilled into money market funds and Treasury bills of up to one year in duration. Now that the debt ceiling battle is behind us, and the Treasury is issuing a huge amount of fresh debt, it\u2019s fair to say, once again, that those investments are safe. You can\u2019t make that claim about tech stocks.There are many ways of comparing the valuation of the stock and bond markets.It\u2019s a little wonky.Basically, the higher the bond yields and the lower the stock earnings, the better bonds stack up, and vice versa. One longstanding metric involves comparing the trailing 12-month earnings yield of the S&P 500 with the yields of Treasury securities. At the moment, bonds are doing nicely in this horse race.The S&P earnings yield is 4.34 percent, according to FactSet, making it lower and, in some respects, less attractive, than the ultrasafe 5 percent-plus yields on one-year Treasuries. Investment-grade corporate bonds are attractive, too. The yields on 10-year Treasuries are lower, well below 4 percent, reducing their appeal.What all this means is that the TINA acronym no longer applies: There are viable alternatives to the stock market right now.\nThese comparisons can go only so far. You aren\u2019t likely to receive double-digit annual returns from high-quality fixed-income investments, while you might in the stock market. But the chances of losing a lot of money in bonds are lower, too.A No-BrainerWith yields above 5 percent, money market funds have a powerful allure. They have been pulling in funds, with total money-market assets in the United States exceeding $5.8 trillion in June, according to Crane Data. Interest rates offered by the nation\u2019s banks are rising, too, but generally trail those of money market funds. The question, for opportunistic fixed-income investors, is whether it\u2019s time to lock in higher yields by holding bonds with durations of 10 or more years. I\u2019m not sure that it is.The Federal Reserve has already told investors that short-term interest rates are likely to rise half a percent further this year. Rising yields would hurt the prices of current long-term bonds, as a matter of basic bond math.On the other hand, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening could set off a recession, which, in turn, would be expected to lead to lower yields and higher prices for bonds.\nThis quandary makes the timing of fixed-income \u2014 as well as stock \u2014 investments tricky.Ms. Jones suggests taking a \u201cbarbell approach,\u201d with much of your investment in very short-term holdings and some of it in five-year bonds, either Treasuries or highly rated investment grade corporates. (A three-year Apple bond has a yield with more than a quarter percentage point premium over three-year Treasury notes, according to FactSet.)I hold bonds mainly through broad index funds, just as I do stocks, owning a piece of thousands of securities throughout the United States and the rest of the world. How much in stock and how much in bonds \u2014 and in short-term holdings like money market funds or high-yield savings accounts \u2014 is a matter of personal preference. I don\u2019t alter my approach much, if at all, because of market shifts.The only real change in my financial life in recent years is that I moved much of my emergency money from bank accounts to money market funds because of superior yields. But with inflation above 4 percent, I try not to kid myself. Even at today\u2019s interest rates, money market funds are barely keeping ahead of rising prices. That\u2019s why I keep putting money in the stock market.But money market funds and savings accounts and, to a lesser extent, bonds, all serve a critical purpose. The money should be waiting, ready for use, even when the stock market is rocky.",

	"text": "Stocks on Wall Street pushed further into bull market territory on Tuesday, climbing after new data showed inflation continues to slow.The Consumer Price Index for May was initially read by investors as moderate enough to ensure the Federal Reserve will hold off on another interest rate increase this week. The central bank will announce its decision on Wednesday.The S&P 500-stock index rose 0.7 percent on Tuesday, to its highest level since January of 2022, extending a strong rally since the index fell to a low point in October. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 20 percent from that 2022 low, a gain that by one definition breaches the threshold for a bull market, a marker of a new phase of exuberance in the markets.Slowing inflation is seen by investors and economists as limiting the need for the Federal Reserve to keep increasing interest rates, with increases so far having raised borrowing costs for consumers and companies and weighed on the broader stock market. Some policymakers had already suggested the Fed might not raise rates again this month, and after the latest inflation data, the likelihood of an increase was close to wiped out in markets.\nNot all investors agree on the best way to define a bull market, especially when concerns over the longer-term trajectory of the U.S. economy remain. The S&P 500 is still roughly 9 percent off its record high, reached at the start of 2022, just before fears of rising interest rates in response to accelerating inflation set in and dragged the index to a loss of around 20 percent.\u201cWith inflation stubbornly high, we do see the business cycle eventually ending in recession,\u201d noted Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, deputy chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.Investor exuberance is nonetheless spreading. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies in the United States that are more exposed to the domestic economy, has rallied more than 8 percent this month, and jumped more than 1 percent in response to the inflation report.The index had trended sideways for much of the year, and even after its rally, it remains less than 15 percent above a low reached 12 months ago.However, the Russell 2000\u2019s recent rise is still indicative of the rally taking hold across the stock market as inflation cools and the economy has remained resilient to the potentially damaging effects higher interest rates can bring.\n\u201cWe are just over two weeks away from the beginning of the third quarter. This is meaningful because to start the year there was a near consensus view that this is when the recession would begin,\u201d said Ms. Wilson-Elizondo. \u201cToday, the recession has not arrived.\u201d",

	"text": "About three weeks ago, at a meeting chaired by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, officials acknowledged that China\u2019s economy was facing \u201cnew difficulties and challenges.\u201dAccording to the official Xinhua News Agency\u2019s summary of the Politburo meeting, officials promised to juice the economy, which had started to rebound at the start of the year after Covid restrictions were lifted but had been struggling. The economic troubles, they said, arose from flagging domestic demand and a \u201cgrim and complex\u201d global economy, among other factors.Chinese stocks jumped at the time, even though officials laid out only vague plans, like using \u201ccountercyclical\u201d regulations, adjusting policies for the troubled real estate sector, and prodding people to buy cars, electronics and household goods.Since then, China has released a string of worrying economic data. Prices consumers and business pay are falling, raising the threat of deflation. Retail sales and industrial production in July missed economists\u2019 expectations, and investment in real estate is plunging.\nAs a result, the stock market has lost its fizz.An index of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong has fallen more than 9 percent this month. The benchmark for stocks that trade in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index, is down a similar amount. Among its members, the laggard is the beleaguered Chinese real estate firm Country Garden, which has lost about half its value this month.A stock index called the CSI 300, which tracks the biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, has dropped about 5 percent.\u201cThe Chinese economy is faced with an imminent downward spiral with the worst yet to come,\u201d analysts at the investment bank Nomura wrote in a report on Tuesday. \u201cBeijing should play the role of lender of last resort to support some major developers and financial institutions in trouble, and should play the role of spender of last resort to boost aggregate demand.\u201dIndeed, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the nation\u2019s central bank, has cut key interest rates to new lows. But critics say that the moves have not been bold enough. Wednesday brought more distressing data: Home prices had fallen in 49 of 70 major cities in the country.The central bank, analysts at Barclays said on Tuesday, would soon lower the amount of reserves banks need to hold, in a bid to stimulate the economy. Barclays cut its forecast for economic growth in China this year to 4.5 percent, from 4.9 percent. Next year would bring even slower growth, the analysts said, with output expanding at 4 percent.\nThe Barclays analysts said that the two biggest issues Beijing needed to address were the housing market and domestic spending, which has been hampered by rising unemployment, particularly among young people. On Tuesday, China said it would stop releasing data on youth unemployment, which was at a record high of 21.3 percent.\u201cThe real estate sector remains a big drag on the economic recovery,\u201d the analysts wrote, adding that a bounce in domestic demand had \u201cstalled amid rising unemployment.\u201dClaire Fu contributed reporting.",

It was followed closely by Meta, the Facebook owner, which has been promoting its own A.I. prowess. Tesla, the electric vehicle champion, wasn\u2019t far behind.But what were cruise ships doing near the very pinnacle of the stock market listings?At midyear, three of the big cruise companies \u2014 Carnival, Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings \u2014 were among the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500.Consider that only three years ago, in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, all cruise lines suspended operations and that in the ensuing months, the shares of publicly traded cruise companies were devastated.\nNow, with fears of contagion ebbing and pent-up demand for pleasure trips being unleashed, cruise lines have had a remarkable change of fortune.Inconsistent Returns\nEach of the cruise line stocks had astonishing gains for the first six months of the year, but they are still down significantly from the start of 2020.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Here are their returns, according to FactSet:Carnival, up 134 percent for the first six months of 2023 but down 63 percent since the start of 2020.Royal Caribbean Group, up 110 percent in the first half of 2023 but down 22 percent since 2020.Norwegian Cruise Line, up 78 percent in the first half of 2023 but down 63 percent since 2020.Returns like these might be puzzling if you were unaware of what happened on the planet in the last three years. But factor in the pandemic and the subsequent economic recovery, and the cruise line stock and bond performance tracks nicely.It\u2019s part of a larger pattern.Just as cruise lines have begun to come into their own, a series of companies that prospered during the pandemic are laggards now. Peloton, Zoom and Etsy are trailing in this year\u2019s stock market performance derby. And major pharmaceutical companies, like Moderna and Pfizer, whose shares took off when the firms were providing scarce and desperately needed vaccines against Covid-19, are among the poorest performers in the S&P 500.\nThe PandemicBriefly put, it wasn\u2019t until December 2019 that the first reports of the emergence of a novel coronavirus began to emanate out of China \u2014 and in March 2020 that the World Health Organization declared that a pandemic was underway. In January, cruise lines began canceling port calls in China.In January 2020, the Diamond Princess, a luxury ship owned by Carnival, began an ill-fated journey in Yokohama, Japan. More than 3,700 passengers and crew members were stranded on board for weeks, with little information about the pandemic.But the virus spread relentlessly, and more than 700 people ultimately tested positive. In those early days of the pandemic, when people lacked natural immunity against the disease, and effective treatment and vaccines were not yet widely available, nine passengers died.All major cruise lines suspended operations, as passengers canceled their bookings en masse. It became evident that a cruise ship wasn\u2019t an ideal place to be in the middle of a pandemic.In the stock market, cruise line shares plummeted as 2020 wore on. In that pandemic year, Carnival fell 57 percent, Royal Caribbean 44 percent, and Norwegian 56 percent. The companies had virtually no revenue and mounting debt, and their ability to remain going concerns was in doubt. They survived by taking on enormous debt loads and paying sky-high junk-bond yields, which were needed to attract investors.\nThe joyful atmosphere needed for a successful vacation at sea seemed unattainable.An Incipient RecoveryIt was only in 2022 that their finances \u2014 and share prices \u2014 stabilized, and only this year that they have begun to report sufficient earnings and cash flow to show signs of paring down their debt and returning to steady profit-making operations. In a conversation with stock analysts after reporting earnings in late June, Josh Weinstein, the chief executive of Carnival, said the company\u2019s business volume was approaching 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic and, in some metrics, beginning to exceed it.According to a transcript of the same session, David Bernstein, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said Carnival was pouring cash into debt reduction, \u201cdriving more than $8 billion in total debt reduction through 2026,\u201d down from a $35 billion peak early in 2023.These debt payments, combined with increased revenues, should enable the company to \u201capproach investment grade\u201d in its bond ratings in 2026, Mr. Bernstein said. Because of Carnival\u2019s improving financial picture, the yields on the company\u2019s debt have been declining and the price of its bonds, which move in the opposite direction, have risen.The specifics of each company matter, of course. What the cruise lines have in common is that all have heightened safety procedures aimed at stemming the spread of any future outbreaks on board, commissioned new ships, taken measures to cut costs and embarked on fresh marketing campaigns. Wall Street analysts, including those at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Jefferies, have given them high grades and helped to drive up their share prices.Perhaps the magic of sea cruises is back. Certainly no one needs a recurrence of the dismal events of 2020.\nIn prepandemic times, I took a couple of lovely cruises. On one trip, three generations of my extended family were able to see the world together, while participating separately in age-appropriate recreation \u2014 on board, in the water and on land. So I\u2019m personally pleased by the beginnings of a sea cruise renaissance, though not ready to sail again quite yet.As an investor, I see the stock performance of the cruise lines this year less as a question of whether this is an opportune time to buy their shares and more as an affirmation of the ever-present need to diversify. What may seem safe today could easily become hazardous tomorrow.Harry Markowitz, a Nobel laureate in economics who died last month, transformed modern investing with his teachings about how rigorous diversification can reduce risk. A decade ago, during a volatile stretch in the stock market, he told me that ordinary investors would be better off if they forgot about individual stocks and bought broad low-cost stock and bond index funds instead.Allocate them in a proportion that makes you comfortable, and then devote yourself to more pleasant pursuits. Mr. Markowitz convinced me. As for pleasant pursuits, go with what delights you.That could even be a sea cruise, if you find them fun and, at this stage, safe enough for a carefree voyage.",

Investors appeared to take to heart assurances that depositors will be protected by federal authorities, helping to calm nerves in the banking sector.First Republic Bank, one of the banks most in the crosshairs of investors in recent days, was up nearly 50 percent, having fallen by a similar amount on Monday. Western Alliance Bancorp rose roughly 40 percent, following a fall of nearly 50 percent. The KBW Bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 banks, rose over 4 percent, its best day in roughly four months.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The rally brushed off inflation data that showed prices continue to rise at a stubbornly high pace. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation cooling slightly for the year through February, but accelerating from the previous month.\nTypically that would garner a strong response from the Federal Reserve, resulting in even higher interest rates that typically weigh on the stock market. But expectations for further rate increases have been moderated by the banking crisis, leaving the Fed in a difficult spot. The central bank has said that it will keep raising interest rates until it has inflation under control but it is those same interest rate increases that were at the root of the pain among banks over the past week.Our business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cPeople are trying to gauge what the Fed is actually going to do given all the new information since the end of last week,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. \u201cI think there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The Fed really has a dilemma on its hands here.\u201dSome investors posited that the crisis in the banking sector appeared contained, boosting sentiment, yet it might still be enough to give the Fed reason to forgo further interest rate increases, bolstering that positive sentiment.Investors\u2019 bets on whether or not the Fed will raise interest rates next week tilted back to expecting a quarter point increase following the hot inflation data, but that\u2019s still markedly lower than where expectations stood a week ago.\u201cThis is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, after the data was released. \u201cAbsent further deterioration in regional banks I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess.\u201d\nIn the bond market, sentiment appeared less hopeful. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, rose by more than 0.3 percentage points \u2014 a large move for an asset that typically rises and falls in tiny fractions of a percentage point. The 10-year Treasury yield remained more anchored, suggesting fading hopes for economic growth over the long term.\u201cI think what is reflected in the bond market is an elevated risk of recession and a credit crunch but for whatever reason it hasn\u2019t reached stock investors yet,\u201d said Ms. Sonders.",

Trading had been muted in the morning, as investors awaited the Fed\u2019s decision.The ructions in the stock market on Wednesday reflected the challenge facing the Fed: to remain tough on stubborn inflation that has driven up prices for households across America, while acknowledging that its tool for cooling inflation \u2014 raising interest rates \u2014 had helped to lead to the recent bout of ill health among the nation\u2019s banks.The central bank initially appeared to thread the needle, and stock prices jolted higher as its decision was announced. But as trading continued, and the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, answered reporters\u2019 questions, the rally subsided, with some investors left unsatisfied that the central bank chief had done enough to quell concerns about the continued fallout from the bank collapses in recent weeks.\n\u201cThis is the Fed making the same policy error that it has routinely made in its history,\u201d said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer for the wealth manager Mercer Advisors. \u201cI think the Fed is slow to react to significant stress in the banking system.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.In the bond market, the two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rates, fell sharply to below 4 percent, as bets mounted that Wednesday\u2019s interest-rate increase could potentially be the Fed\u2019s last.The Fed has been raising interest rates to restrict the economy and slow inflation. While that was part of the reason for the flare-up in the banking sector, that stress in the financial system could now apply even more pressure on the economy, removing some of the need for the Fed to keep raising interest rates.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cThis is being viewed as either the last, or close to the last, hike,\u201d said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG Securities. \u201cThey were going to be really aggressive on inflation, but the banking crisis has done it for them.\u201dReeling from the series of bank collapses that prompted intervention from regulators around the world and generated violent swings in financial markets, investors, analysts and economists had been left guessing what the Fed might do on Wednesday \u2014 uncertainty that had been reflected in whipsaw trading over the past two weeks.\nTypically, the Fed likes to set investors\u2019 expectations, leading them to the likely outcome of rate decisions, limiting any potential market fallout from a surprise move. But Mr. Powell\u2019s last public comments came just days before regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank, with the Fed chair testifying to Congress that he was open to raising interest rates more quickly in response to data that showed inflation stubbornly embedded within the economy.As the economic backdrop has sharply shifted since Mr. Powell\u2019s comment, investors were left in the dark about what the central bank would do \u2014 stick to earlier plans, or adjust to the new set of circumstances.After a bout of banking turmoil that reverberated around the world, many had begun to believe that the Fed could instead leave rates unchanged.PacWest, a Los Angeles lender that has come under pressure alongside other regional banks, said on Wednesday that it had tapped emergency cash after a 20 percent drop in its deposits since the start of the year.The announcement sent PacWest\u2019s stock price tumbling, down about 17 percent for the day, dragging the share prices of other regional banks lower as well. The moves illustrated the tumultuous backdrop preceding the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates.\u201cI think the Fed is underreacting,\u201d Mr. Calcagni said. \u201cI think there is more stress in the financial system than the Fed thinks.\u201d",

The news sent stock prices sharply higher and Treasury yields plummeting.The S&P 500 rose 1.4 percent after the Fed released its projections for where the economy and interest rates would be by the end of 2024. The rally left it less than 2 percent below the high that was recorded at the start of January 2022, just before fear of higher rates sent the stock market tumbling. The Dow Jones industrial average, viewed as a barometer of the economy because it includes big manufacturing companies that tend to be more sensitive to the economic cycle, also rose 1.4 percent, to a new high.In a positive sign for the broader market, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which also tends to follow the ebb and flow of the domestic economy, rose 3.5 percent.\u201cThe market loves it, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments, after the Fed\u2019s economic projections were released.\nThe Fed\u2019s rapid rate increases since March 2022 have sent shock waves through financial markets, raising borrowing costs on things like mortgages and government debt and weighing on the stock market.On Wednesday, the Fed appeared to confirm something investors have come to expect for a couple of months: Its campaign of raising interest rates is at an end. A sustained slowdown in inflation, bringing it closer to the central bank\u2019s target, has become clearer in recent months. At the same time, continued resilience in the broader economy has meant investors haven\u2019t had to worry as much about the downside of high borrowing costs.Fed officials forecast roughly three rate cuts of a quarter-point each next year, more than they predicted when the Fed met back in September.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, moved abruptly in response to the Fed\u2019s projections, sliding more than a quarter of a percentage point to around 4.4 percent, its biggest one-day decline since the banking crisis in March.Analysts are now split on where the market will go from here. Some caution that with growth waning, and inflation still yet to slow fully to the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent, rate cuts may be needed to prop up the economy, rather than just to adjust to slower inflation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my expectation that we will see growth continue to slow, and if the Fed is cutting, they are cutting a lot and quickly,\u201d said Ms. Goodwin.",

But be aware that unless you take on some risk, you won\u2019t get much of a return. This risk-return trade-off is an essential part of investing, even if you have a low threshold for risk.Perhaps you can\u2019t afford to lose money, don\u2019t have enough time to recover from a temporary loss or just can\u2019t stand the very idea of putting your money at risk.If any of this sounds like you, there is some good news. Interest rates are far higher than they were just a couple of years ago, though they have fallen a bit lately. For risk-averse investors, the terms of the classic trade-off have shifted in your favor. Without taking on more short-term risk, you can get better returns.\nStill, fixed-income investments aren\u2019t a panacea. Over the long run, they have returned less than the overall stock market and are likely to do so in the future. Paradoxically, if you overemphasize safety by loading up too heavily on fixed income, you may be giving up a degree of prosperity later. Balancing these issues is what the risk-return trade-off is all about.When Rates Were LowLower interest rates tend to stimulate the economy. They are better for borrowers \u2014 including people who want to take out a mortgage or pay down a credit card, or finance a business. Lower rates also benefit risk-taking investors because the stock market tends to flourish when money is cheap.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But higher rates are better for people who are saving money, including risk-averse investors who have managed to build a nest egg and want to convert it into a safe, rich stream for retirement. To their chagrin, interest rates \u2014 also known as yields \u2014 began dropping in 2007 in the early days of the financial crisis. This meant that if you bought a newly issued security and held it to maturity, you would have received little income in return. It\u2019s only this year, and thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s long battle against inflation, that long-term interest rates have risen back to levels that prevailed before the financial crisis.The effects of shifting yields can be stark for anyone hoping to live off the income stream produced by bonds or annuities.Consider this. A retiree who bought a 10-year Treasury note in January 2000 was able to lock in a yield of 6.68 percent \u2014 generating $6,680 annually on a $100,000 investment for the next decade. But by January 2009, deep into the financial crisis, the yield on a newly purchased 10-year Treasury was only 2.87 percent \u2014 producing a mere $2,870 annually on the same size of an investment.\nThe implications of these low yields for risk-averse investors weren\u2019t widely reported at first, probably because for bond traders \u2014 who are looking for profit, not years of guaranteed income \u2014 falling yields were a good thing.Remember, as part of bond math, yields and prices move in opposite directions. When market yields dropped, people who already owned bonds and sold them benefited from higher prices. Falling yields were also generally helpful for those who owned bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Bond fund returns are determined both by yields \u2014 which were dropping \u2014 and by prices, which rose. For longer-term securities held by funds, the price gains typically outweighed the losses.The Painful PartBut for risk-averse investors seeking stable long-term returns, it\u2019s precisely when yields are low that problems arise. That began to happen more than a decade ago. In a 2013 column, I pointed out that a risk-averse newly retired couple with a $1 million nest egg invested in fixed-income holdings at the time could easily exhaust their holdings within one decade, because their stream of income would be quite low. They would probably improve their prospects, I suggested, if they shifted some investments into the stock market.And, indeed, market returns over the last decade show that assessment was on the mark. The S&P 500, a benchmark for the U.S. stock market, returned nearly 12 percent, annualized, while the investment-grade bond market returned only 1.5 percent.But investing in stocks entails risk. Retirees would have had to have enough resources \u2014 both financial and emotional \u2014 to withstand gut-wrenching declines.\nAnother safe option existed. The couple in 2013 could also have increased their retirement income reasonably safely by buying a cheap, simple annuity \u2014 a single premium immediate annuity (often denoted by its acronym, SPIA) \u2014 to supplement their retirement savings and Social Security payments. In 2013, a $100,000 investment in such an annuity by a 65-year-old would have generated an average $6,348 annual lifetime payout for a man and $5,904 for a woman, the archive of the website immediateannuities.com shows.Both income streams were far higher than the couple would have received from 10-year Treasuries when the 2013 column was written, but lower than the stock market produced.Higher RatesToday, for the risk-averse, the situation is more favorable.A newly purchased 10-year Treasury will produce around $4,250 in annual income on a $100,000 investment \u2014 compared with a mere $640 on a new Treasury note purchased in April 2020.Income from single premium immediate annuities is also much better. In April 2020, when interest rates were low, the annual lifetime payout on a $100,000 investment for a 65-year-old was $5,676 for man and $5,352 for a woman. In November, the payouts had risen to $7,380 for a 65-year-old man and $7,068 for a woman.As a practical matter, bonds offer much more flexibility than annuities, through either buying a series of individual bonds with maturities tailored to your needs or holding an investment-grade bond fund, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\u201cHigher rates are, of course, better for people who want the income that bonds provide,\u201d she said.Total ReturnBut investing only in fixed income isn\u2019t ideal, even for retirees, with the possible exception of those with an expected life span of only a few more years and limited resources. For one thing, even when interest rates are high, inflation will eat away at least some of the income.\u201cYou want to be careful that you don\u2019t succumb to \u2018money illusion,\u2019\u201d said Joel Dickson, global head of advice methodology at Vanguard. \u201cYou can think that you\u2019re doing fine,\u201d he said, but your spending power will decline as prices rise.The stock market tends to outpace inflation over extended periods, and Mr. Dickson and Ms. Jones both said a \u201ctotal return\u201d approach probably made sense for most people, even retirees. This means keeping a well-diversified portfolio of stocks in addition to bonds.Remember there are trade-offs in investing. There\u2019s no one perfect answer for everyone. Yes, higher rates are a boon if you need to lock in income. But the total return from holdings that include stocks is likely to outperform pure fixed-income investments, if you have the time and the stomach to withstand major market downturns.",

	"text": "Stocks rose on Thursday afternoon, after a second day of volatility in which the S&P 500 swung between gains and losses.The index rose 0.3 percent by the end of the day. It had earlier climbed more than 1.7 percent, but gave up that gain before climbing again.The big swings this week have come as investors have wrestled with the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rapid interest-rate increases on the banking system. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, continuing its campaign to dampen inflation. It was the ninth increase in borrowing costs in a year.But the Fed also acknowledged that it may be near the end of its rate-raising cycle, and that turmoil in the banking system, set off by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, could push it to pause. If banks pull back on lending as a result of turbulence in the financial system, making it harder for consumers to borrow and spend, that could dampen inflation by slowing the economy.\nInvestors remain worried about the health of the banking system. The jump in rates over the past year pummeled the value of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s investment portfolio, which started a run on deposits as the bank\u2019s customers feared it could fail. When it did collapse, that raised fears that other banks may also succumb, particularly smaller lenders with less diversified deposit bases.The shakiness of bank balance sheets is one reason many investors are betting that the Fed will stop raising rates, and may even start cutting them later this year. That is despite statements to the contrary by policymakers, who say that the fight against stubbornly high inflation is not finished.\u201cMarkets are, so far, not trusting the ability of the Fed to treat inflation and financial stability independently,\u201d analysts at ING wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cThis looks unlikely to change soon.\u201dThough the concern over small banks has certainly eased somewhat in recent days, trading on Thursday showed that investors are still uneasy: PacWest Bank, Zions Bancorp and First Republic Bank were all lower.On Thursday, central banks in Britain, Norway and Switzerland also raised rates. The Bank of England\u2019s quarter-point increase was its 11th consecutive move higher, and policymakers said that the country\u2019s banking system was able to withstand a period of higher rates.\nShares in London slipped after the decision, with the FTSE 100 down about half a percent.",

	"text": "The stock market has been strutting into the spotlight lately, with talk \u2014 however premature \u2014 of a new A.I.-driven bull market popping up nearly everywhere you turn.Amid all the hoopla, you can easily miss the solid returns being posted by far less glamorous but always important and, at the moment, compelling asset classes: fixed-income investments, including bonds and cash.Especially for those with short time horizons \u2014 whether you\u2019re in retirement or close to it, or saving for a house, education, a car, a vacation or any other worthwhile purpose \u2014 these lower-risk investments are worth a close look.Until a little over a year ago, when interest rates were about as low as they could go, a mantra on Wall Street was TINA. It\u2019s an acronym for \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d to the stock market, certainly not from fixed-income investments.\nNow, though, it\u2019s a different world: Interest rates, or yields, have risen significantly. That\u2019s bad if you\u2019re borrowing, but if you have money to invest or stash somewhere safe so you can pay your bills, there are plenty of appealing options.It is debatable whether it\u2019s wise to lock in higher interest rates now, or stick with shorter-term holdings until it\u2019s clear that the Federal Reserve is done raising interest rates. But the time to appreciate the benefits of fixed-income holdings like money market funds and Treasury bills is already here.Even if you are just starting out in your first job, it\u2019s a good idea to try to keep an emergency fund in short-term, interest-bearing accounts. That\u2019s also true if you have reached a time of life when drawing down your assets, and making them last, are your main concerns. For the moment, it\u2019s possible to get safe returns that are beating inflation.But Stocks Are BoomingStill, the returns on short-term fixed-income investments are likely to be in the mid-single digits, at best. That\u2019s not going to make you rich. But a winning stock could.There have been some rough patches in the stock market. Even so, the returns of big tech stocks so far have been fabulous. Nvidia, which churns out some of the chips that make A.I. run, was up almost 190 percent for the calendar year as of Thursday. Apple, Alphabet (Google) and Microsoft were all up more than 35 percent; Meta (Facebook) and Tesla gained more than 100 percent. Wow.\nBut for high-flying tech stocks like these, timing is everything. Many are still down from the market\u2019s peak on Jan. 3, 2022. So is the benchmark S&P 500 index, which is why I\u2019m not confident this is a bull market for stocks, at least not quite yet.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.I\u2019m waiting for the S&P 500 to attain its old lofty level before giving it the bull market designation. And even if the market reaches that pinnacle, I don\u2019t expect to be increasing my personal allocation to stocks.Why? Two big reasons.First, I never reduced that allocation when stocks were falling. I held on then because I couldn\u2019t predict where the market was going. (Wall Street prognosticators can\u2019t do it reliably either, as a long history of failed forecasts shows.)I\u2019m a permanent investor in both stocks and bonds. There\u2019s no need to increase the stock proportion of my portfolio now.Second, I\u2019m not entirely happy about putting money into companies that aren\u2019t producing profits sufficient to justify the investment. Take Nvidia. Its shares have lifted the returns of the S&P 500, but that\u2019s because it\u2019s trading at a lofty price. Its price-to-earnings ratio, which compares price to profits, is now uncomfortably high \u2014 about 10 times that of the S&P 500, according to FactSet data. \nEssentially, Nvidia profits will need to soar for many years to justify the company\u2019s price. Perhaps artificial intelligence will make that happen. I\u2019m not counting on that, though.So I\u2019m hanging in without great enthusiasm. History suggests that the overall stock market will rise over the long haul, but doesn\u2019t tell us anything about what will happen next month or next week, and it doesn\u2019t help much in deciding whether particular companies are worth owning. I\u2019ll hold the entire market through index funds but I\u2019m not eager to take extra risks with my hard-earned money.That\u2019s where bonds and cash come in. They provide solid income with much less risk than stocks \u2014 in theory, anyway.The Effects of Higher YieldsIt didn\u2019t work out well for bonds last year.At the start of the year, money market funds offered virtually no interest and bond returns ranged from mediocre to terrible, depending on the month. Stocks were said to be the only game in town.Interest rates rose as the Federal Reserve battled inflation, and the bond market cratered. Because yields (interest rates) and prices move in opposite directions, and yields started off at rock-bottom levels, soaring interest rates led to the greatest bond market losses of the last century. The Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index, a benchmark for investment-grade bonds, lost 15 percent in 2022, according to FactSet. The S&P 500 was even worse, with a 20 percent decline, though that was scant consolation if you held a lot of bonds, or bond funds, that you thought were safe.\nNow, it\u2019s a different landscape.Bonds are more reliable than they were last year because yields are already high. Even if they elevate further, there is a plush cushion now, and any potential price declines should be offset, and then some, by the income that bonds are generating. Bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds aren\u2019t likely to experience declines in last year\u2019s range either. \u201cBond math tells us it won\u2019t happen,\u201d Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, said in an interview.With the federal funds rate above 5 percent, rich yield has spilled into money market funds and Treasury bills of up to one year in duration. Now that the debt ceiling battle is behind us, and the Treasury is issuing a huge amount of fresh debt, it\u2019s fair to say, once again, that those investments are safe. You can\u2019t make that claim about tech stocks.There are many ways of comparing the valuation of the stock and bond markets.It\u2019s a little wonky.Basically, the higher the bond yields and the lower the stock earnings, the better bonds stack up, and vice versa. One longstanding metric involves comparing the trailing 12-month earnings yield of the S&P 500 with the yields of Treasury securities. At the moment, bonds are doing nicely in this horse race.The S&P earnings yield is 4.34 percent, according to FactSet, making it lower and, in some respects, less attractive, than the ultrasafe 5 percent-plus yields on one-year Treasuries. Investment-grade corporate bonds are attractive, too. The yields on 10-year Treasuries are lower, well below 4 percent, reducing their appeal.What all this means is that the TINA acronym no longer applies: There are viable alternatives to the stock market right now.\nThese comparisons can go only so far. You aren\u2019t likely to receive double-digit annual returns from high-quality fixed-income investments, while you might in the stock market. But the chances of losing a lot of money in bonds are lower, too.A No-BrainerWith yields above 5 percent, money market funds have a powerful allure. They have been pulling in funds, with total money-market assets in the United States exceeding $5.8 trillion in June, according to Crane Data. Interest rates offered by the nation\u2019s banks are rising, too, but generally trail those of money market funds. The question, for opportunistic fixed-income investors, is whether it\u2019s time to lock in higher yields by holding bonds with durations of 10 or more years. I\u2019m not sure that it is.The Federal Reserve has already told investors that short-term interest rates are likely to rise half a percent further this year. Rising yields would hurt the prices of current long-term bonds, as a matter of basic bond math.On the other hand, the Fed\u2019s monetary tightening could set off a recession, which, in turn, would be expected to lead to lower yields and higher prices for bonds.\nThis quandary makes the timing of fixed-income \u2014 as well as stock \u2014 investments tricky.Ms. Jones suggests taking a \u201cbarbell approach,\u201d with much of your investment in very short-term holdings and some of it in five-year bonds, either Treasuries or highly rated investment grade corporates. (A three-year Apple bond has a yield with more than a quarter percentage point premium over three-year Treasury notes, according to FactSet.)I hold bonds mainly through broad index funds, just as I do stocks, owning a piece of thousands of securities throughout the United States and the rest of the world. How much in stock and how much in bonds \u2014 and in short-term holdings like money market funds or high-yield savings accounts \u2014 is a matter of personal preference. I don\u2019t alter my approach much, if at all, because of market shifts.The only real change in my financial life in recent years is that I moved much of my emergency money from bank accounts to money market funds because of superior yields. But with inflation above 4 percent, I try not to kid myself. Even at today\u2019s interest rates, money market funds are barely keeping ahead of rising prices. That\u2019s why I keep putting money in the stock market.But money market funds and savings accounts and, to a lesser extent, bonds, all serve a critical purpose. The money should be waiting, ready for use, even when the stock market is rocky.",

	"text": "Stocks on Wall Street pushed further into bull market territory on Tuesday, climbing after new data showed inflation continues to slow.The Consumer Price Index for May was initially read by investors as moderate enough to ensure the Federal Reserve will hold off on another interest rate increase this week. The central bank will announce its decision on Wednesday.The S&P 500-stock index rose 0.7 percent on Tuesday, to its highest level since January of 2022, extending a strong rally since the index fell to a low point in October. The S&P 500 has climbed more than 20 percent from that 2022 low, a gain that by one definition breaches the threshold for a bull market, a marker of a new phase of exuberance in the markets.Slowing inflation is seen by investors and economists as limiting the need for the Federal Reserve to keep increasing interest rates, with increases so far having raised borrowing costs for consumers and companies and weighed on the broader stock market. Some policymakers had already suggested the Fed might not raise rates again this month, and after the latest inflation data, the likelihood of an increase was close to wiped out in markets.\nNot all investors agree on the best way to define a bull market, especially when concerns over the longer-term trajectory of the U.S. economy remain. The S&P 500 is still roughly 9 percent off its record high, reached at the start of 2022, just before fears of rising interest rates in response to accelerating inflation set in and dragged the index to a loss of around 20 percent.\u201cWith inflation stubbornly high, we do see the business cycle eventually ending in recession,\u201d noted Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo, deputy chief investment officer of multi-asset solutions at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.Investor exuberance is nonetheless spreading. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies in the United States that are more exposed to the domestic economy, has rallied more than 8 percent this month, and jumped more than 1 percent in response to the inflation report.The index had trended sideways for much of the year, and even after its rally, it remains less than 15 percent above a low reached 12 months ago.However, the Russell 2000\u2019s recent rise is still indicative of the rally taking hold across the stock market as inflation cools and the economy has remained resilient to the potentially damaging effects higher interest rates can bring.\n\u201cWe are just over two weeks away from the beginning of the third quarter. This is meaningful because to start the year there was a near consensus view that this is when the recession would begin,\u201d said Ms. Wilson-Elizondo. \u201cToday, the recession has not arrived.\u201d",

	"text": "About three weeks ago, at a meeting chaired by Xi Jinping, China\u2019s leader, officials acknowledged that China\u2019s economy was facing \u201cnew difficulties and challenges.\u201dAccording to the official Xinhua News Agency\u2019s summary of the Politburo meeting, officials promised to juice the economy, which had started to rebound at the start of the year after Covid restrictions were lifted but had been struggling. The economic troubles, they said, arose from flagging domestic demand and a \u201cgrim and complex\u201d global economy, among other factors.Chinese stocks jumped at the time, even though officials laid out only vague plans, like using \u201ccountercyclical\u201d regulations, adjusting policies for the troubled real estate sector, and prodding people to buy cars, electronics and household goods.Since then, China has released a string of worrying economic data. Prices consumers and business pay are falling, raising the threat of deflation. Retail sales and industrial production in July missed economists\u2019 expectations, and investment in real estate is plunging.\nAs a result, the stock market has lost its fizz.An index of Chinese stocks traded in Hong Kong has fallen more than 9 percent this month. The benchmark for stocks that trade in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index, is down a similar amount. Among its members, the laggard is the beleaguered Chinese real estate firm Country Garden, which has lost about half its value this month.A stock index called the CSI 300, which tracks the biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, has dropped about 5 percent.\u201cThe Chinese economy is faced with an imminent downward spiral with the worst yet to come,\u201d analysts at the investment bank Nomura wrote in a report on Tuesday. \u201cBeijing should play the role of lender of last resort to support some major developers and financial institutions in trouble, and should play the role of spender of last resort to boost aggregate demand.\u201dIndeed, the People\u2019s Bank of China, the nation\u2019s central bank, has cut key interest rates to new lows. But critics say that the moves have not been bold enough. Wednesday brought more distressing data: Home prices had fallen in 49 of 70 major cities in the country.The central bank, analysts at Barclays said on Tuesday, would soon lower the amount of reserves banks need to hold, in a bid to stimulate the economy. Barclays cut its forecast for economic growth in China this year to 4.5 percent, from 4.9 percent. Next year would bring even slower growth, the analysts said, with output expanding at 4 percent.\nThe Barclays analysts said that the two biggest issues Beijing needed to address were the housing market and domestic spending, which has been hampered by rising unemployment, particularly among young people. On Tuesday, China said it would stop releasing data on youth unemployment, which was at a record high of 21.3 percent.\u201cThe real estate sector remains a big drag on the economic recovery,\u201d the analysts wrote, adding that a bounce in domestic demand had \u201cstalled amid rising unemployment.\u201dClaire Fu contributed reporting.",

It was followed closely by Meta, the Facebook owner, which has been promoting its own A.I. prowess. Tesla, the electric vehicle champion, wasn\u2019t far behind.But what were cruise ships doing near the very pinnacle of the stock market listings?At midyear, three of the big cruise companies \u2014 Carnival, Royal Caribbean Group and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings \u2014 were among the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500.Consider that only three years ago, in the first months of the coronavirus pandemic, all cruise lines suspended operations and that in the ensuing months, the shares of publicly traded cruise companies were devastated.\nNow, with fears of contagion ebbing and pent-up demand for pleasure trips being unleashed, cruise lines have had a remarkable change of fortune.Inconsistent Returns\nEach of the cruise line stocks had astonishing gains for the first six months of the year, but they are still down significantly from the start of 2020.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Here are their returns, according to FactSet:Carnival, up 134 percent for the first six months of 2023 but down 63 percent since the start of 2020.Royal Caribbean Group, up 110 percent in the first half of 2023 but down 22 percent since 2020.Norwegian Cruise Line, up 78 percent in the first half of 2023 but down 63 percent since 2020.Returns like these might be puzzling if you were unaware of what happened on the planet in the last three years. But factor in the pandemic and the subsequent economic recovery, and the cruise line stock and bond performance tracks nicely.It\u2019s part of a larger pattern.Just as cruise lines have begun to come into their own, a series of companies that prospered during the pandemic are laggards now. Peloton, Zoom and Etsy are trailing in this year\u2019s stock market performance derby. And major pharmaceutical companies, like Moderna and Pfizer, whose shares took off when the firms were providing scarce and desperately needed vaccines against Covid-19, are among the poorest performers in the S&P 500.\nThe PandemicBriefly put, it wasn\u2019t until December 2019 that the first reports of the emergence of a novel coronavirus began to emanate out of China \u2014 and in March 2020 that the World Health Organization declared that a pandemic was underway. In January, cruise lines began canceling port calls in China.In January 2020, the Diamond Princess, a luxury ship owned by Carnival, began an ill-fated journey in Yokohama, Japan. More than 3,700 passengers and crew members were stranded on board for weeks, with little information about the pandemic.But the virus spread relentlessly, and more than 700 people ultimately tested positive. In those early days of the pandemic, when people lacked natural immunity against the disease, and effective treatment and vaccines were not yet widely available, nine passengers died.All major cruise lines suspended operations, as passengers canceled their bookings en masse. It became evident that a cruise ship wasn\u2019t an ideal place to be in the middle of a pandemic.In the stock market, cruise line shares plummeted as 2020 wore on. In that pandemic year, Carnival fell 57 percent, Royal Caribbean 44 percent, and Norwegian 56 percent. The companies had virtually no revenue and mounting debt, and their ability to remain going concerns was in doubt. They survived by taking on enormous debt loads and paying sky-high junk-bond yields, which were needed to attract investors.\nThe joyful atmosphere needed for a successful vacation at sea seemed unattainable.An Incipient RecoveryIt was only in 2022 that their finances \u2014 and share prices \u2014 stabilized, and only this year that they have begun to report sufficient earnings and cash flow to show signs of paring down their debt and returning to steady profit-making operations. In a conversation with stock analysts after reporting earnings in late June, Josh Weinstein, the chief executive of Carnival, said the company\u2019s business volume was approaching 2019 levels for the first time since the start of the pandemic and, in some metrics, beginning to exceed it.According to a transcript of the same session, David Bernstein, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said Carnival was pouring cash into debt reduction, \u201cdriving more than $8 billion in total debt reduction through 2026,\u201d down from a $35 billion peak early in 2023.These debt payments, combined with increased revenues, should enable the company to \u201capproach investment grade\u201d in its bond ratings in 2026, Mr. Bernstein said. Because of Carnival\u2019s improving financial picture, the yields on the company\u2019s debt have been declining and the price of its bonds, which move in the opposite direction, have risen.The specifics of each company matter, of course. What the cruise lines have in common is that all have heightened safety procedures aimed at stemming the spread of any future outbreaks on board, commissioned new ships, taken measures to cut costs and embarked on fresh marketing campaigns. Wall Street analysts, including those at JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Jefferies, have given them high grades and helped to drive up their share prices.Perhaps the magic of sea cruises is back. Certainly no one needs a recurrence of the dismal events of 2020.\nIn prepandemic times, I took a couple of lovely cruises. On one trip, three generations of my extended family were able to see the world together, while participating separately in age-appropriate recreation \u2014 on board, in the water and on land. So I\u2019m personally pleased by the beginnings of a sea cruise renaissance, though not ready to sail again quite yet.As an investor, I see the stock performance of the cruise lines this year less as a question of whether this is an opportune time to buy their shares and more as an affirmation of the ever-present need to diversify. What may seem safe today could easily become hazardous tomorrow.Harry Markowitz, a Nobel laureate in economics who died last month, transformed modern investing with his teachings about how rigorous diversification can reduce risk. A decade ago, during a volatile stretch in the stock market, he told me that ordinary investors would be better off if they forgot about individual stocks and bought broad low-cost stock and bond index funds instead.Allocate them in a proportion that makes you comfortable, and then devote yourself to more pleasant pursuits. Mr. Markowitz convinced me. As for pleasant pursuits, go with what delights you.That could even be a sea cruise, if you find them fun and, at this stage, safe enough for a carefree voyage.",

Investors appeared to take to heart assurances that depositors will be protected by federal authorities, helping to calm nerves in the banking sector.First Republic Bank, one of the banks most in the crosshairs of investors in recent days, was up nearly 50 percent, having fallen by a similar amount on Monday. Western Alliance Bancorp rose roughly 40 percent, following a fall of nearly 50 percent. The KBW Bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 banks, rose over 4 percent, its best day in roughly four months.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The rally brushed off inflation data that showed prices continue to rise at a stubbornly high pace. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation cooling slightly for the year through February, but accelerating from the previous month.\nTypically that would garner a strong response from the Federal Reserve, resulting in even higher interest rates that typically weigh on the stock market. But expectations for further rate increases have been moderated by the banking crisis, leaving the Fed in a difficult spot. The central bank has said that it will keep raising interest rates until it has inflation under control but it is those same interest rate increases that were at the root of the pain among banks over the past week.\u201cPeople are trying to gauge what the Fed is actually going to do given all the new information since the end of last week,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. \u201cI think there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The Fed really has a dilemma on its hands here.\u201dSome investors posited that the crisis in the banking sector appeared contained, boosting sentiment, yet it might still be enough to give the Fed reason to forgo further interest rate increases, bolstering that positive sentiment.Investors\u2019 bets on whether or not the Fed will raise interest rates next week tilted back to expecting a quarter point increase following the hot inflation data, but that\u2019s still markedly lower than where expectations stood a week ago.\u201cThis is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, after the data was released. \u201cAbsent further deterioration in regional banks I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess.\u201d\nIn the bond market, sentiment appeared less hopeful. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, rose by more than 0.3 percentage points \u2014 a large move for an asset that typically rises and falls in tiny fractions of a percentage point. The 10-year Treasury yield remained more anchored, suggesting fading hopes for economic growth over the long term.\u201cI think what is reflected in the bond market is an elevated risk of recession and a credit crunch but for whatever reason it hasn\u2019t reached stock investors yet,\u201d said Ms. Sonders.",

Trading had been muted in the morning, as investors awaited the Fed\u2019s decision.The ructions in the stock market on Wednesday reflected the challenge facing the Fed: to remain tough on stubborn inflation that has driven up prices for households across America, while acknowledging that its tool for cooling inflation \u2014 raising interest rates \u2014 had helped to lead to the recent bout of ill health among the nation\u2019s banks.The central bank initially appeared to thread the needle, and stock prices jolted higher as its decision was announced. But as trading continued, and the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, answered reporters\u2019 questions, the rally subsided, with some investors left unsatisfied that the central bank chief had done enough to quell concerns about the continued fallout from the bank collapses in recent weeks.\n\u201cThis is the Fed making the same policy error that it has routinely made in its history,\u201d said Don Calcagni, chief investment officer for the wealth manager Mercer Advisors. \u201cI think the Fed is slow to react to significant stress in the banking system.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.In the bond market, the two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rates, fell sharply to below 4 percent, as bets mounted that Wednesday\u2019s interest-rate increase could potentially be the Fed\u2019s last.The Fed has been raising interest rates to restrict the economy and slow inflation. While that was part of the reason for the flare-up in the banking sector, that stress in the financial system could now apply even more pressure on the economy, removing some of the need for the Fed to keep raising interest rates.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cThis is being viewed as either the last, or close to the last, hike,\u201d said George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG Securities. \u201cThey were going to be really aggressive on inflation, but the banking crisis has done it for them.\u201dReeling from the series of bank collapses that prompted intervention from regulators around the world and generated violent swings in financial markets, investors, analysts and economists had been left guessing what the Fed might do on Wednesday \u2014 uncertainty that had been reflected in whipsaw trading over the past two weeks.\nTypically, the Fed likes to set investors\u2019 expectations, leading them to the likely outcome of rate decisions, limiting any potential market fallout from a surprise move. But Mr. Powell\u2019s last public comments came just days before regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank, with the Fed chair testifying to Congress that he was open to raising interest rates more quickly in response to data that showed inflation stubbornly embedded within the economy.As the economic backdrop has sharply shifted since Mr. Powell\u2019s comment, investors were left in the dark about what the central bank would do \u2014 stick to earlier plans, or adjust to the new set of circumstances.After a bout of banking turmoil that reverberated around the world, many had begun to believe that the Fed could instead leave rates unchanged.PacWest, a Los Angeles lender that has come under pressure alongside other regional banks, said on Wednesday that it had tapped emergency cash after a 20 percent drop in its deposits since the start of the year.The announcement sent PacWest\u2019s stock price tumbling, down about 17 percent for the day, dragging the share prices of other regional banks lower as well. The moves illustrated the tumultuous backdrop preceding the Fed\u2019s decision to raise interest rates.\u201cI think the Fed is underreacting,\u201d Mr. Calcagni said. \u201cI think there is more stress in the financial system than the Fed thinks.\u201d",

The news sent stock prices sharply higher and Treasury yields plummeting.The S&P 500 rose 1.4 percent after the Fed released its projections for where the economy and interest rates would be by the end of 2024. The rally left it less than 2 percent below the high that was recorded at the start of January 2022, just before fear of higher rates sent the stock market tumbling. The Dow Jones industrial average, viewed as a barometer of the economy because it includes big manufacturing companies that tend to be more sensitive to the economic cycle, also rose 1.4 percent, to a new high.In a positive sign for the broader market, the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which also tends to follow the ebb and flow of the domestic economy, rose 3.5 percent.\u201cThe market loves it, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments, after the Fed\u2019s economic projections were released.\nThe Fed\u2019s rapid rate increases since March 2022 have sent shock waves through financial markets, raising borrowing costs on things like mortgages and government debt and weighing on the stock market.On Wednesday, the Fed appeared to confirm something investors have come to expect for a couple of months: Its campaign of raising interest rates is at an end. A sustained slowdown in inflation, bringing it closer to the central bank\u2019s target, has become clearer in recent months. At the same time, continued resilience in the broader economy has meant investors haven\u2019t had to worry as much about the downside of high borrowing costs.Fed officials forecast roughly three rate cuts of a quarter-point each next year, more than they predicted when the Fed met back in September.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, moved abruptly in response to the Fed\u2019s projections, sliding more than a quarter of a percentage point to around 4.4 percent, its biggest one-day decline since the banking crisis in March.Analysts are now split on where the market will go from here. Some caution that with growth waning, and inflation still yet to slow fully to the Fed\u2019s target of 2 percent, rate cuts may be needed to prop up the economy, rather than just to adjust to slower inflation.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my expectation that we will see growth continue to slow, and if the Fed is cutting, they are cutting a lot and quickly,\u201d said Ms. Goodwin.",

	"text": "\u201cAll investments involve taking on risk.\u201d That\u2019s a standard Securities and Exchange Commission warning.Be careful. But be aware that unless you take on some risk, you won\u2019t get much of a return. This risk-return trade-off is an essential part of investing, even if you have a low threshold for risk.Perhaps you can\u2019t afford to lose money, don\u2019t have enough time to recover from a temporary loss or just can\u2019t stand the very idea of putting your money at risk.If any of this sounds like you, there is some good news. Interest rates are far higher than they were just a couple of years ago, though they have fallen a bit lately. For risk-averse investors, the terms of the classic trade-off have shifted in your favor. Without taking on more short-term risk, you can get better returns.\nStill, fixed-income investments aren\u2019t a panacea. Over the long run, they have returned less than the overall stock market and are likely to do so in the future. Paradoxically, if you overemphasize safety by loading up too heavily on fixed income, you may be giving up a degree of prosperity later. Balancing these issues is what the risk-return trade-off is all about.When Rates Were LowLower interest rates tend to stimulate the economy. They are better for borrowers \u2014 including people who want to take out a mortgage or pay down a credit card, or finance a business. Lower rates also benefit risk-taking investors because the stock market tends to flourish when money is cheap.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But higher rates are better for people who are saving money, including risk-averse investors who have managed to build a nest egg and want to convert it into a safe, rich stream for retirement. To their chagrin, interest rates \u2014 also known as yields \u2014 began dropping in 2007 in the early days of the financial crisis. This meant that if you bought a newly issued security and held it to maturity, you would have received little income in return. It\u2019s only this year, and thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s long battle against inflation, that long-term interest rates have risen back to levels that prevailed before the financial crisis.The effects of shifting yields can be stark for anyone hoping to live off the income stream produced by bonds or annuities.Consider this. A retiree who bought a 10-year Treasury note in January 2000 was able to lock in a yield of 6.68 percent \u2014 generating $6,680 annually on a $100,000 investment for the next decade. But by January 2009, deep into the financial crisis, the yield on a newly purchased 10-year Treasury was only 2.87 percent \u2014 producing a mere $2,870 annually on the same size of an investment.\nThe implications of these low yields for risk-averse investors weren\u2019t widely reported at first, probably because for bond traders \u2014 who are looking for profit, not years of guaranteed income \u2014 falling yields were a good thing.Remember, as part of bond math, yields and prices move in opposite directions. When market yields dropped, people who already owned bonds and sold them benefited from higher prices. Falling yields were also generally helpful for those who owned bond mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Bond fund returns are determined both by yields \u2014 which were dropping \u2014 and by prices, which rose. For longer-term securities held by funds, the price gains typically outweighed the losses.The Painful PartBut for risk-averse investors seeking stable long-term returns, it\u2019s precisely when yields are low that problems arise. That began to happen more than a decade ago. In a 2013 column, I pointed out that a risk-averse newly retired couple with a $1 million nest egg invested in fixed-income holdings at the time could easily exhaust their holdings within one decade, because their stream of income would be quite low. They would probably improve their prospects, I suggested, if they shifted some investments into the stock market.And, indeed, market returns over the last decade show that assessment was on the mark. The S&P 500, a benchmark for the U.S. stock market, returned nearly 12 percent, annualized, while the investment-grade bond market returned only 1.5 percent.But investing in stocks entails risk. Retirees would have had to have enough resources \u2014 both financial and emotional \u2014 to withstand gut-wrenching declines.\nAnother safe option existed. The couple in 2013 could also have increased their retirement income reasonably safely by buying a cheap, simple annuity \u2014 a single premium immediate annuity (often denoted by its acronym, SPIA) \u2014 to supplement their retirement savings and Social Security payments. In 2013, a $100,000 investment in such an annuity by a 65-year-old would have generated an average $6,348 annual lifetime payout for a man and $5,904 for a woman, the archive of the website immediateannuities.com shows.Both income streams were far higher than the couple would have received from 10-year Treasuries when the 2013 column was written, but lower than the stock market produced.Higher RatesToday, for the risk-averse, the situation is more favorable.A newly purchased 10-year Treasury will produce around $4,250 in annual income on a $100,000 investment \u2014 compared with a mere $640 on a new Treasury note purchased in April 2020.Income from single premium immediate annuities is also much better. In April 2020, when interest rates were low, the annual lifetime payout on a $100,000 investment for a 65-year-old was $5,676 for man and $5,352 for a woman. In November, the payouts had risen to $7,380 for a 65-year-old man and $7,068 for a woman.As a practical matter, bonds offer much more flexibility than annuities, through either buying a series of individual bonds with maturities tailored to your needs or holding an investment-grade bond fund, said Kathy Jones, chief fixed-income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\n\u201cHigher rates are, of course, better for people who want the income that bonds provide,\u201d she said.Total ReturnBut investing only in fixed income isn\u2019t ideal, even for retirees, with the possible exception of those with an expected life span of only a few more years and limited resources. For one thing, even when interest rates are high, inflation will eat away at least some of the income.\u201cYou want to be careful that you don\u2019t succumb to \u2018money illusion,\u2019\u201d said Joel Dickson, global head of advice methodology at Vanguard. \u201cYou can think that you\u2019re doing fine,\u201d he said, but your spending power will decline as prices rise.The stock market tends to outpace inflation over extended periods, and Mr. Dickson and Ms. Jones both said a \u201ctotal return\u201d approach probably made sense for most people, even retirees. This means keeping a well-diversified portfolio of stocks in addition to bonds.Remember there are trade-offs in investing. There\u2019s no one perfect answer for everyone. Yes, higher rates are a boon if you need to lock in income. But the total return from holdings that include stocks is likely to outperform pure fixed-income investments, if you have the time and the stomach to withstand major market downturns.",

It had earlier climbed more than 1.7 percent, but gave up that gain before climbing again.The big swings this week have come as investors have wrestled with the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s rapid interest-rate increases on the banking system. On Wednesday, the Fed raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, continuing its campaign to dampen inflation. It was the ninth increase in borrowing costs in a year.But the Fed also acknowledged that it may be near the end of its rate-raising cycle, and that turmoil in the banking system, set off by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank earlier this month, could push it to pause. If banks pull back on lending as a result of turbulence in the financial system, making it harder for consumers to borrow and spend, that could dampen inflation by slowing the economy.\nInvestors remain worried about the health of the banking system. The jump in rates over the past year pummeled the value of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s investment portfolio, which started a run on deposits as the bank\u2019s customers feared it could fail. When it did collapse, that raised fears that other banks may also succumb, particularly smaller lenders with less diversified deposit bases.The shakiness of bank balance sheets is one reason many investors are betting that the Fed will stop raising rates, and may even start cutting them later this year. That is despite statements to the contrary by policymakers, who say that the fight against stubbornly high inflation is not finished.\u201cMarkets are, so far, not trusting the ability of the Fed to treat inflation and financial stability independently,\u201d analysts at ING wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. \u201cThis looks unlikely to change soon.\u201dThough the concern over small banks has certainly eased somewhat in recent days, trading on Thursday showed that investors are still uneasy: PacWest Bank, Zions Bancorp and First Republic Bank were all lower.On Thursday, central banks in Britain, Norway and Switzerland also raised rates. The Bank of England\u2019s quarter-point increase was its 11th consecutive move higher, and policymakers said that the country\u2019s banking system was able to withstand a period of higher rates.\nShares in London slipped after the decision, with the FTSE 100 down about half a percent.",

	"text": "The week\u2019s dizzying swings in financial markets continued on Thursday, as investors welcomed a group of big banks stepping in to support their smaller peer First Republic Bank, helping ease some of the turmoil emanating from regional lenders.The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent, after recovering from an early drop, in a rally that gained steam after news that a group of 11 banks would deposit a combined $30 billion with First Republic, which has come into investors\u2019 cross hairs after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.First Republic\u2019s stock price swung from a deep loss to a gain of more than 10 percent, a swift recovery but one that erased only a small amount of the damage from a bruising week. Even after the rally on Thursday, First Republic has lost more than 70 percent of its market value this month, wiping roughly $16 billion from its valuation.A slew of other small banks, like Western Alliance and PacWest, were also lifted by the news of the intervention.\nDespite the broad rally on Thursday, the destabilizing volatility this week has investors braced for further stress in the financial system, stemming from the substantial shift away from a decade of low interest rates. Goldman Sachs, for example, has raised its odds that the U.S. economy could slip into recession over the next 12 months, \u201creflecting increased near-term uncertainty around the economic effects of small bank stress.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the recent bout of turmoil had served as a warning. \u201cUntil this week, markets had broadly ignored the threats that tightening policy was starting to uncover,\u201d she said.The broader recovery in the market on Thursday also lifted shares of energy companies, which had come under pressure following a swift slide in the price of oil on Wednesday. Oil prices, which are sensitive to the prospect of a global downturn sapping demand for the commodity, also rose slightly, but a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, the American benchmark, remained close to its lowest level since the end of 2021.Our business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Broader markets had appeared more settled even before the news of the First Republic rescue. The S&P 500 remains up for the year and is on course to close out its second-best week of 2023, absent another reversal on Friday.Investors had largely shrugged off a 0.5 percentage point rate increase from the European Central Bank, taking solace from a rebound in the share price of Credit Suisse, the embattled European bank, after it said it would tap a lifeline from the Swiss central bank and borrow up to $54 billion.\nThe Stoxx 600 index, which tracks shares of the biggest companies in Europe, finished 1.2 percent higher, and shares of Credit Suisse jumped almost 20 percent, recovering some of the steep loss from the day before that stoked fear about the lender\u2019s financial health.Central banks have been raising interest rates to try to rein in inflation, but higher rates also mean higher costs for companies, contributing to the pain experienced by some banks in recent days.Policymakers must now balance the desire to continue slowing inflation with the potential for it to risk further instability in financial markets. Analysts noted that the E.C.B.\u2019s decision took on heightened importance ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting next week, and yields on U.S. government bonds rose, as investors leaned toward bets that the Fed would follow the E.C.B. in raising its benchmark rate next week.Still, traders in futures markets continued to bet that the Fed will cut interest rates later this year as inflation continues to fall and the economy continues to deteriorate, even though the central bank and its chair, Jerome H. Powell, have so far said that there are no plans to do so.\u201cThe balance of risks has undoubtedly shifted,\u201d noted Daleep Singh, the chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cThe risks from too much tightening are now at least equal to, and likely larger than, the risks of doing too little. We expect Fed Chair Powell to pair a final rate hike next week with a message that Fed policy will then go on an extended pause, with the possibility of resuming rate hikes later \u2014 or initiating rate cuts \u2014 in the second half of the year.\u201dJin Yu Young and Vivek Shankar contributed reporting.",

The central bank has been increasing borrowing costs since March of last year in an attempt to rein in economic activity and slow the pace of price increases.The numbers came amid some debate in markets over whether the Fed will have to continue with that campaign \u2014 in particular amid signs of a still healthy labor market and other factors that could inhibit policymakers\u2019 efforts to temper inflation. But Tuesday\u2019s report helped cement a view in financial markets that the Fed\u2019s efforts are working. \nThe government reported that the overall Consumer Price Index slowed to 3.2 percent last month on a year-over-year basis, lower than the 3.7 percent reading in September and the coolest since July.In the bond market, the two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in investors\u2019 interest rate expectations, slumped nearly 0.2 percentage points on Tuesday to around 4.85 percent \u2014 a huge move for an asset that typically rises and falls by hundredths of a percentage point.Alongside dialing down any likelihood that the Fed will surprise markets and still raise rates at its next meeting, in December, investors have also begun to bet on when the Fed will begin to lower interest rates. Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, recently said that decision was not even being considered by the central bank\u2019s officials as they looked to keep the brakes on the economy until inflation fell further toward their target of just 2 percent.\u201cThis takes a rate hike off the table in December and reinforces our call that July was the last hike of the cycle, and the process will now shift to the Fed attempting to delay cuts as long as possible,\u201d analysts at BMO Capital Markets noted.",

	"text": "Stocks slumped Friday to cap their worst week of the year, as investors balked at fresh government data that added to a flurry of signals showing a resurgence in inflation.The S&P 500 fell 1.1 percent by the end of the trading day, adding to losses earlier in the week and recording its third straight week of declines.That came in a shortened week, with markets closed on Monday for the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday. Tuesday\u2019s trading notched the worst single day for the S&P 500 since mid-December, helping to push the index to its worst weekly performance of the year: a decline of 2.7 percent.The turn in the market this month has come alongside a sharp reassessment among investors about what the Federal Reserve will have to do to lower inflation, and the damage that might inflict on companies, consumers and the economy.\nStock markets had rallied through January as investors pinned their hopes on a potential pause to the Fed\u2019s rate increases, after a sustained period of slowing inflation at the end of last year.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But that hope has been undone in recent weeks by data showing employers have kept hiring, consumers have kept spending and inflation has been re-accelerating. On Friday, the latest reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which the Fed tracks closely, showed inflation accelerating faster than expected in January.\u201cI think the market reaction we are seeing very clearly suggests investors think that the Fed has more work to do,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The Fed has been raising interest rates for almost a year, as it seeks to slow the economy and temper inflation. Higher interest rates also raise costs for companies, which typically weighs on stock prices.Investors have ratcheted up their forecasts for how many times the Fed will raise interest rates, this week cementing expectations for three quarter-point rate increases at the central bank\u2019s next three meetings. At the start of the month, investors expected just one more increase, at the meeting in March. They have even started to seriously price in the possibility that the Fed could go with a bigger increase in March, of half a point.\nIn response, bond yields have soared, with the two-year Treasury yield, a gauge of government borrowing costs that is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, reaching a post-pandemic peak on Friday. The yield rose more than a tenth of a percentage point, to 4.81 percent, its highest since 2007. That was a big move for an asset that usually rises and falls by hundredths of a point each day.The 10-year Treasury yield, which underpins borrowing costs across the globe, approached 4 percent, a threshold it hasn\u2019t risen above since November last year.Amid the volatility, investors have pulled cash from markets, withdrawing roughly $9 billion from funds that buy U.S. stocks in the seven days through Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global. That brought flows out of U.S. stocks for the past three weeks to almost $19 billion.The selling has been broad based, with every sector of the S&P 500 seeing losses so far this month. Technology stocks, which are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, outperformed at the start of the year, but that had begun to shift more recently. On Friday, the sector sank over 1.8 percent, underperforming the broader market.\u201cThe tug of war between bulls and bears has temporarily swung back in favor of the bears,\u201d said Mark Hackett, the chief of investment research at Nationwide.",

	"text": "Stocks dropped on Friday, signaling that investors had little confidence that the banking crisis had run its course despite moves to shore up flailing lenders with injections of tens of billions of dollars.The shares of many banks resumed their dizzying slide, erasing gains from Thursday that had provided a brief moment of calm during a tumultuous week. First Republic, the beleaguered regional lender, lost a third of its already beaten-down value on Friday alone. The S&P 500 stock index fell about 1.1 percent \u2014 the week\u2019s worst day of trading.President Biden asked Congress on Friday to grant financial regulators broad new powers to punish the executives of failed lenders. A day earlier, data showed that banks in the United States borrowed record amounts from the Federal Reserve this week to meet short-term needs, another sign of acute stresses in the financial system.The crisis was set in motion last week when clients of Silicon Valley Bank began to demand deposits as they worried about the losses the lender was taking on some investments. The run on deposits was too much, and regulators seized SVB.\nA second bank, Signature in New York, fell days later, providing the backdrop to a week of whipsaw trading that undermined confidence in the banking sector and prompted concerns about the effects on the economy.\u201cSentiment remains weak, and investor positioning remains conservative,\u201d said Mark Hackett, the chief of investment research at the insurance company Nationwide. \u201cHowever, investors should recognize that this is not a repeat of the financial crisis. It is disruptive for the industry and painful for a select group of banks and institutions, but the comparison to the financial crisis is premature.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Still, investors have begun to worry about the longer-term implications of financial turmoil, analysts said. Even if the small banks can remain solvent, a pullback in lending activity, if it came with the economy under pressure, could have broader implications, making cash less available to businesses when they might need it most. It also means less new business for the banks themselves, after a period when some lost sizable deposits.\u201cThe solvency concerns have not completely gone away,\u201d said Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar. \u201cBut even if you solve the concerns from a bank run, if a bank loses a large amount of its deposits and they don\u2019t return, then basically that bank has lost a large amount of its earnings potential.\u201dFirst Republic\u2019s shares fell more than 30 percent on Friday. Other regional banks also came under pressure, with PacWest and Western Alliance both falling between 15 and 20 percent. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank that received a multibillion-dollar rescue on Thursday, also lost ground in European trading.\nThe KBW bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 US banks, skidded more than 5 percent and has lost over 20 percent of its value this year, versus a small gain in the broader market over that period.\nOn Thursday, First Republic, whose stock price has cratered this month, announced a $30 billion rescue package funded by the largest banks in the United States. The bank also suspended its dividend and said it would take measures to reduce its debt.JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo agreed to each place $5 billion in uninsured deposits with First Republic. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, mainstays of Wall Street, pitched in $2.5 billion apiece, and five regional banks added $1 billion each.\nThe banks, normally fierce rivals, issued a joint statement explaining their move: \u201cAmerica\u2019s larger banks stand united with all banks to support our economy and all of those around us.\u201dThe deputy Treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, said on CNBC on Friday that U.S. officials were seeing deposit levels stabilizing in small and midsize banks, and in some cases modestly rising.\u201cThis was due in no small fact to the way that we resolved the two institutions that failed,\u201d he said, referring to the government takeovers of Silicon Valley Bank, a once-obscure lender to the tech world, and the small Signature Bank.But analysts at UBS wrote on Friday that investors were likely to see First Republic\u2019s rescue as a short-term fix and that banking stocks would \u201ctruly settle only after the market feels as if there is a longer-term solution\u201d to First Republic\u2019s woes. (The deposits given to First Republic from other banks are uninsured and for an initial term of 120 days.)Mr. Biden\u2019s appeal for legislation would expand the regulator powers held by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which took control of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature. The proposal would allow the agency to claw back compensation from executives of failed banks, as well as bar them from taking other jobs in the financial industry.\nOther signs of anxiety also persisted. Data from the Federal Reserve released on Thursday showed that banks borrowed record amounts of emergency funds from the central bank in recent days, tapping both existing facilities and a new program to shore up liquidity that was announced after the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature.\u201cThis has given me more conviction on my negative view, but I don\u2019t think the world is falling apart,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.The events of the past week, Ms. Shah added, may have brought forward the timeline in which the economy slips into recession. \u201cThe concern is what else will be unearthed? What else is out there?\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Alan Rappeport, Keith Bradsher, Rob Copeland and Lauren Hirsch.",

	"text": "Stocks in Hong Kong entered a bear market on Friday, down 21 percent from their high near the start of the year, as investors around the world grew increasingly worried that the deteriorating condition of China\u2019s real estate sector could spill over into the broader economy.The slump in the Hang Seng Index, which is made up mostly of companies from China\u2019s mainland, comes as the country\u2019s economy confronts weakening growth. After three years of harsh Covid restrictions, foreign investment is down, consumers are spending less and the housing market is in turmoil.Bear markets, when stocks drop at least 20 percent from their most recent peak, are a relatively rare signal that investors view the economy with serious pessimism. The Hang Seng fell just over 2 percent on Friday, and about 6 percent for the week. The index is down more than 10 percent so far this month.Global investors are also wary of the effects of China\u2019s weakening economy, which has added to worries about inflation and high interest rates in Europe and the United States. On Friday, European stocks mostly fell and the S&P 500 was flat. The U.S. benchmark index is on track to record its third consecutive weekly decline.\nA small rise in oil prices on Friday, to about $81 per barrel, was not enough to reverse the first weekly decline since June for West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which underpins borrowing costs across the economy, slipped on Friday to about 4.2 percent, after touching its highest level since 2007 a day earlier.\u201cMarkets are being hit by the perfect storm,\u201d analysts at Barclays wrote in a report on Friday, citing rising interest rates, grim economic data in China and other factors.A real estate crisis is at the heart of the concerns over China. Among the companies hit hardest recently is the Chinese real estate giant Country Garden, whose shares are trading well below one Hong Kong dollar. Another behemoth developer, China Evergrande, sought bankruptcy protection in the United States on Thursday as it struggled to settle with creditors over tens of billions of dollars in debt.Highlighting the depths of the downturn, Soho China, a Hong Kong-listed developer of office buildings in mainland China, on Friday reported a plunge in first-half profit of more than 90 percent. The company said in a statement that \u201cmarket confidence was yet to be restored.\u201dChinese stocks had bounced after officials in December lifted the government\u2019s extreme \u201czero Covid\u201d measures that sharply curtailed economic activity. But hopes that China\u2019s economy would show a sustained recovery faded as the country released a string of concerning economic statistics. Prices fell, raising the threat of deflation; retail sales and industrial production missed economists\u2019 expectations; and real estate investments dwindled.\nExports, a cornerstone of China\u2019s economy, have fallen. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has sunk to its lowest level in years. A number of major banks have downgraded their forecasts for how much China\u2019s economy will grow in 2023, to levels below the government\u2019s target of about 5 percent. The most recent official numbers indicate that China was growing at an annual growth rate of about 3 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.China\u2019s policymakers have responded with a series of measures aimed at encouraging consumers to spend more and banks to step up their lending. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has cut key interest rates to new lows, while securities regulators have proposed ways to make trading stocks cheaper and easier. But the moves have done little to bolster the confidence of investors or generate greater economy activity.\nOne problem weighing heavily on China is debt, particularly at local governments that depend greatly on the real estate market. Overall debt in China is now larger, relative to national economic output, than in the United States.And so the stock market has lost steam. In Hong Kong, stocks have declined for six consecutive days, and eight of the past 10 trading sessions.\nStocks have also tumbled in mainland China. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, has dropped about 10 percent since its January high.The situation for investors is brighter in the United States, where the S&P 500 index, even after recent declines, is up about 14 percent this year, buoyed by optimism about technology \u2014 especially the prospects for artificial intelligence, and the chip makers that power those applications \u2014 and the resilience of consumer spending.Still, the benchmark index has shed about 5 percent of its value this month, chipping away at the gains recorded in recent months. \u201cThe U.S. economy remains strong, while China continues disappointing at the margin and global investors are becoming increasingly concerned,\u201d Claudio Irigoyen, an economist at Bank of America, wrote in a report. This \u201cdecoupling\u201d could eventually \u201ccontaminate sentiment\u201d enough to precipitate a sharper fall in global markets, he added.J. Edward Moreno contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After a tumultuous couple of days, stock markets in the United States were poised to rise on Monday as regulators moved to limit the contagion from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Futures contracts on the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 percent overnight, while those on the Nasdaq climbed 1.7 percent.In Asia, most stock markets were off their lows by Monday afternoon. Officials in Japan, South Korea and India, some of the largest economies in the region, assuaged concerns of a global ripple effect emanating from the United States.The worries had been centered on the banking system, which in the past year has had to contend with rising interest rates. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, its investment strategy based on rates became a money loser, leading to the lender\u2019s demise.\nNow, investors expect the Federal Reserve to change its approach to raising interest rates, a move that could ease pressure on banks.\u201cMarkets are pricing for a pause in rate hikes in March,\u201d said Tina Teng, an analyst with CMC Markets in Auckland, New Zealand. Investors, she added, believe that U.S. authorities can contain the risk in the banking system.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index was down 1.4 percent, while the South Korean benchmark erased losses and was up 0.5 percent. Indexes in greater China were outliers, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rising more than 2 percent after China\u2019s central bank governor, Yi Gang, was reappointed to the job in a surprise move.Silicon Valley Bank is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., and had been a favored lender of the region\u2019s start-ups. Its troubles came to light after another bank\u2019s collapse: Silvergate, a California-based bank that made loans to cryptocurrency companies, announced Wednesday that it would cease operations and liquidate its assets.On Friday, regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank, guaranteeing that deposits of up to $250,000 were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as is the norm. But there was concern that many of the bank\u2019s clients would be on the hook for losses because the bank had many accounts over that limit.\nThen on Sunday, the Fed, the Treasury and the F.D.I.C. issued a joint statement, saying that \u201cdepositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.\u201d The regulators stressed that \u201cno losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.\u201d Also on Sunday, regulators shut down Signature Bank in New York.The Fed is also setting up an emergency lending program, with approval from the Treasury, to funnel funding to eligible banks so they can \u201cmeet the needs of all their depositors.\u201dOne early beneficiary was San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, which on Sunday said that it received additional funding from the Fed and the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.",

	"text": "This summer, when Hong Kong\u2019s stock market rout seemed to have no end in sight, the city\u2019s financial chief, Paul Chan, jumped into action, creating a task force to inject confidence into a market that was being pummeled by global investors wary of China.Hong Kong cut taxes on trading, and Mr. Chan went on a roadshow to Europe and the United States, promising measures to \u201clet investors feel optimistic about the outlook.\u201d Investors were anything but sanguine, however, and the city\u2019s stock exchange is among the world\u2019s worst-performing stock markets this year.The Hang Seng Index finished Friday, its last trading day in 2023, 14 percent lower than it started the year. Stocks in mainland China also recorded losses this year, with the CSI 300, an index that tracks companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, declining 11 percent.Hundreds of billions of dollars flowed out this year as money managers and pension funds reduced their holdings in Hong Kong, which has long been a gateway for foreign investors wanting to put money into mainland China. The outflows were largely driven by an economic downturn in China and mounting pressure on American investors to sell their exposure to Chinese companies.\n\u201cMany of the companies in the Hang Seng Index are essentially companies that are leveraged to economic growth in China,\u201d said Chetan Seth, an Asia equity strategist at Nomura, a Japanese bank. \u201cChina\u2019s weak economy clearly has weighed on the performance of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong,\u201d Mr. Seth said.\nThe losses in Hong Kong and the mainland contrasted sharply to what happened in the United States, where inflation eased and the job market was strong. The S&P 500, which broadly tracks U.S. stocks, was up 25 percent in 2023, underlining the divergent paths of the world\u2019s two largest economies.Global investors started the year optimistic that China\u2019s economy would bounce back after three years of strict pandemic rules and lockdowns. But when China fully opened its borders in January for the first time since 2020, many households were reluctant to spend. Private businesses floundered, and the economy slowed.\nChina\u2019s roiling property crisis has intensified the economic slump and spilled over into Hong Kong. After years of overexpansion and borrowing from foreign investors in Hong Kong, nearly every private Chinese real estate developer has collapsed.Chinese property companies listed in Hong Kong were among the worst-performing stocks. The real estate developer Country Garden, one of the biggest casualties of the property crisis, has lost nearly three-quarters of its value this year as it edges closer to a collapse.Mr. Chan, the finance secretary, has blamed \u201cmisunderstandings caused by Western political prejudices\u201d for the stock market\u2019s poor performance, as geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington hit a low point during the year. But 2023 was the fourth consecutive year that the Hang Seng recorded losses. Over that same time, Hong Kong\u2019s role as a financial nerve center for Asia diminished as it was forced to align more closely with Beijing under a far-reaching national security law.\nHong Kong\u2019s loss of autonomy to China has worried some global investors.A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 with a pledge that it would maintain a high degree of self-governance under a policy called \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d For two decades, this allowed Hong Kong to define itself as unique and distinct from the rest of China, while offering financial access to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\nBut after citywide protests in 2019, Beijing imposed the national security law, which has silenced political debate and stifled civic activity.More than 100,000 residents have left Hong Kong over the last few years, in part because of the security law and tough pandemic restrictions. Many young Hong Kong professionals who are still there have expressed a desire to leave, making it a challenge to recruit the talent that has helped the city function as a financial center.Once a major hub for Wall Street banks, Hong Kong had a drought of initial public offerings this year. Companies raised the lowest amount of money since 2001, resulting in layoffs at financial institutions citywide.Many international companies have stopped hiring for new positions in Hong Kong. With less money coming into the exchange and fewer transactions, dozens of brokerages have also closed.China\u2019s downturn, geopolitics, elections in major economies including the United States and the actions of central banks are all likely to make 2024 another volatile year for Hong Kong.Addressing some of these issues in an interview in a recent interview with the South China Morning Post, Mr. Chan said, \u201c2024 will be a year of high uncertainty.\u201d",

	"text": "Heat, drought, flood and famine. Evidence of climate change is all around us.If the planet is to avoid even more severe consequences from global warming, the world\u2019s leading energy agency says, consumption of oil, coal and natural gas needs to be reduced much more rapidly, and clean energy sources like wind and solar power need to expand at a far faster pace.But the stock market doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten the memo.Instead, the shares of a broad range of clean energy companies have been crushed lately, in a rout that encompasses just about every alternative energy sector, including solar, wind and geothermal power.At the same time, rather than weaning themselves off oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two biggest U.S. oil companies, are doubling down. They have announced acquisitions that will vastly increase their oil reserves. Exxon intends to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a major shale drilling company, for $59.5 billion. Chevron plans a $53 billion purchase of Hess, a big integrated oil company. These are enormous bets on oil for years to come.It\u2019s a perplexing state of affairs. The evidence that carbon emissions are warming the planet is persuasive. Yet the stock market, which is supposed to be forward-looking, is treating alternative energy companies with disdain and big oil companies with respect.\nThere\u2019s something wrong here, obviously.I think the problem resides with the stock market, not the scientists.Benjamin Graham, the great value investor and Columbia professor, once said, \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201dThat means that eventually the market gets things right, but in the short run, it\u2019s prone to enthusiasms, snap judgments and myopic thinking.That seems to be what\u2019s happening now.The Big Picture\nThe scientific consensus is clear. It sometimes seems there is a new and compelling study on climate change, with disturbing conclusions, every day.\nLast month, for example, in its latest comprehensive report on the world\u2019s chances of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2050, the International Energy Agency, the world\u2019s leading energy authority, said the climate was warming all too rapidly. The probability of a benign outcome is receding, it said, yet odds will improve if the world shifts aggressively from fossil to alternative fuels.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.In a separate study released this past week, a group of scientists said the planet probably had only a little over five years before global warming would exceed the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement: warming of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above temperatures that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution.Breach that limit and there will be catastrophes far worse than what we have experienced so far, the study said. Already, the planet has warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius. Governments, companies and consumers around the world need to take aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions immediately, the study said.If the stock market heeded such calls to action, you might expect that the alternative energy shares would be booming and that big oil companies would be pouring most of their money into renewable resources.But in its collective wisdom, the stock market seems to be embracing a different and contrary vision.\nStock LossesHundreds of billions of dollars are, in fact, being invested in renewable energy projects, even if the stock market generally isn\u2019t favoring them right now.The returns are ugly. The iShares Global Clean Energy E.T.F., an exchange-traded fund that tracks the entire industry, is down more than 30 percent this year. Even worse, since the start of 2021, it has lost more than 50 percent.Narrower sectors are being punished, too. The Invesco Solar E.T.F. is down more than 40 percent this year and almost 60 percent since Jan. 1, 2021. The First Trust Global Wind Energy E.T.F. has lost about 20 percent this year and about 40 percent since Jan. 1, 2021.Rising interest rates have increased costs and tempered consumer enthusiasm in many countries, reducing stock valuations for fast-growing companies that aren\u2019t churning out big profits. Renewable energy companies have been hard hit.\nSolarEdge, which provides equipment needed to convert energy from solar panels into power that can be transmitted through electric grids, warned on Oct. 17 that demand for its products was lagging. The market responded harshly.\nShares of the company, which is based in Israel, dropped nearly 30 percent in a single day. A host of other solar companies followed. Enphase Energy, a rival firm in Fremont, Calif., has lost almost 40 percent since Oct. 17.Wind energy companies haven\u2019t been spared, either. Shares of Orsted, the Danish wind turbine company, fell nearly 26 percent on Wednesday after it said it might have to write down as much as $5.6 billion on the value of its offshore wind projects in the United States.One Orsted venture, South Fork Wind, a set of turbines being installed 30 miles east of Montauk Point, is scheduled to start sending electricity to Long Island before the end of the year. But the company canceled two projects, known as Ocean Wind 1 and 2, that were to supply New Jersey with green energy, and some of its projects for New York and Connecticut have run into trouble, too.In October, New York State\u2019s Public Service Commission rejected requests from Orsted and several other companies \u2014 including BP and Equinor \u2014 for billions in electric rate increases to help defray their ballooning costs. The companies say that with inflation and higher interest rates increasing their costs, the viability of some of their projects in the New York metropolitan area is in doubt.\nBetting on Fossil FuelBig oil company profits and revenue have flagged since last year, when energy prices soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.For the entire S&P 500, earnings per share in the third quarter grew only 2.7 percent from a year earlier, John Butters, a senior earnings analyst for FactSet, estimated. Exclude the big energy companies, though, and that total increased to 8.4 percent. That\u2019s because earnings per share for big, fossil fuel energy companies declined 38.1 percent, more than for any other sector.Oil prices are volatile, and their trajectory in the years ahead is far from certain. But Exxon and Chevron are staking their futures on oil. Exxon\u2019s acquisition of Pioneer would be its biggest purchase since it bought Mobil in 1999. And Chevron will deepen its commitment to oil by acquiring Hess.Though I know better, I can\u2019t stop thinking of Hess as \u201cthe green company.\u201d That\u2019s only because I\u2019m an old New York Jets fan. Hess shares corporate history and a green-and-white motif with the Jets. Leon Hess founded the company, owned the team and liked the color green. But the Hess product line is petroleum-based. It\u2019s not a green company otherwise.\nBut no matter. Oil has been good to Hess\u2019s shareholders, and to shareholders of the three other companies. Over the last three years, Exxon has returned about 275 percent, including dividends; Chevron, 135 percent; Pioneer, 260 percent; and Hess, a whopping 310 percent. The S&P 500 returned about 32 percent.As long as the world consumes oil, companies like these will be profitable, or so oil bulls say.Plus, there is a wild card.As the World Bank warned on Monday, if the war between Israel and Hamas widens, conflict in the Middle East could easily set off a steep surge in oil prices. An escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian war could make oil soar as well. So could any number of potential military or political conflicts.If scientific findings dominate, oil could become a stranded asset, one that can\u2019t be sold. But the market consensus is that the viable life of Big Oil has a long way to go.Confounding ChoicesWhat are we to make of the messages the market is sending?For one thing, I wouldn\u2019t view them as inevitable. Prices shift every minute, and despite its vaunted reputation, the stock market doesn\u2019t provide a guide to the future. Sometimes it can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of it, and it certainly can\u2019t see around corners. I remain hopeful, despite discouraging tidings from the stock market.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t dismiss the stock market\u2019s signals entirely. Market prices incorporate the views of an awful lot of people who can\u2019t agree on much, except, at a particular moment, on the appropriate price for a specific offering. In that sense, the market is, as Benjamin Graham said, a voting machine.Pouring money into unprofitable ventures isn\u2019t a good strategy unless those ventures ultimately generate a great deal of cash. The jury is still out on many alternative energy companies, much as the world needs their products. Oil companies, on the other hand, are prized for their ability to gush cash.But if you\u2019re seeking a guide to the future, don\u2019t count on the stock market. I expect it to rise over the long run, and to make fickle and foolish choices along the way.",

	"text": "Wall Street\u2019s longest weekly winning streak in almost 20 years came to an end on Friday, as stock investors\u2019 celebrations over slowing inflation and the potential for cuts to interest rates were replaced with caution over the lingering risks to the economy.The S&P 500 index ended the week with a loss of 1.5 percent. It was the first weekly drop after nine straight weeks of gains \u2014 the market\u2019s longest winning streak since January 2004. The Nasdaq Composite, chock-full of tech stocks that soared in 2023, has also drifted lower.Analysts and investors said that for the time being the moves signaled only a mild pullback, rather than the start of a more severe downturn. Investors\u2019 unbridled optimism had pushed the S&P 500 almost 14 percent higher in the final two months of the year, to within a whisker of a new high.Alongside caution that stock market valuations had risen too far too quickly, investors\u2019 newfound sobriety was underpinned by a reassessment of when the Federal Reserve would begin to lower interest rates \u2014 cuts that could bolster stock prices, corporate profits and consumer spending. Heading into the end of 2023, investors were betting that rate cuts could start as soon as March.\n\u201cThe market has got a bit ahead of itself,\u201d Cayla Seder, a macro strategist at State Street, said, noting the risk that the slowdown in inflation could still reverse course. \u201cThere was so much optimism going into the end of the year.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Minutes of the Fed\u2019s last meeting in December, released on Wednesday, confirmed perceptions that the central bank\u2019s stance has shifted, with policymakers acknowledging a slowdown in inflation that probably means an end to further interest rate increases. But the minutes suggested policymakers are intent on keeping rates elevated until they are more confident that inflation is under control, putting pressure on the bets of a rate cut in the coming months. That, in turn, has weighed on stocks.On Friday, new data showed that the labor market remained strong in December, cementing confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience but also stoking concerns that inflation could yet reignite as wages continued to rise. The S&P 500 ended the day about 0.2 percent higher, though that was not enough to reverse the losses earlier in the week.The early slide marks the S&P 500\u2019s worst start to a year since 2015, though analysts cautioned about drawing strong conclusions from just four days of trading.Many of the stocks that propelled the market higher last year have been the anchor weighing it down in 2024. All of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which include the biggest companies in the market that have an outsized impact on returns, rank among the worst performers for the week.\nCollectively, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) and Meta (Facebook\u2019s parent) are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the S&P 500\u2019s drop since Jan. 2. Without them, the index would have fallen less than 1 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Apple, down about 6 percent since last Friday, has come under sustained pressure after two analysts downgraded their outlook for the company, pointing to falling iPhone sales that have contributed to contracting revenues.Some analysts say stock prices could fall further. While investors have dialed down bets on a rate cut coming in March, they are still expecting that a gradual slowdown in the economy will give the Fed license to cut borrowing costs by 0.75 percentage points by the end of July \u2014 as much as the central bank forecast in December for the whole of 2024.If the economy proves stronger than anticipated, the central bank is likely to hold rates higher for longer, disappointing investors. A sharp deterioration in the health of the economy could result in rate cuts, but for more worrying reasons.\u201cIt\u2019s all very Goldilocks,\u201d said George Goncalves, chief macro strategist at MUFG Securities. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d\nA rise in longer-term borrowing costs, underpinned by the rate paid on government bonds, could also unsettle stock investors, after a stunning rally late last year dragged the yield on the 10-year Treasury down by roughly a percentage point to around 4 percent. Some bond traders surveyed by J.P. Morgan went into this week betting on a reversal of some of that move, and Friday\u2019s jobs data has already helped to push yields higher.\u201cOne of the big risks of leaning into a Fed relief rally is that after a couple of months, investors usually realize that the Fed is pulling back on interest rate hiking policy because they are seeing growth slow,\u201d which tends to be \u201cless constructive\u201d for the stock market, said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.For many analysts, though, a modest pullback in the market was warranted after the searing rally at the end of 2023, with most stock market prognosticators still forecasting a rise in the S&P 500 over the next year.Roger Aliaga-Diaz, an economist at Vanguard, said the balance of risk had tilted toward a \u201crosy scenario\u201d while \u201cignoring all the risks that are, in our view, still there.\u201d\u201cWe are not out of the woods in terms of inflation,\u201d he warned.",

	"text": "The week\u2019s dizzying swings in financial markets continued on Thursday, as investors welcomed a group of big banks stepping in to support their smaller peer First Republic Bank, helping ease some of the turmoil emanating from regional lenders.The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent, after recovering from an early drop, in a rally that gained steam after news that a group of 11 banks would deposit a combined $30 billion with First Republic, which has come into investors\u2019 cross hairs after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.First Republic\u2019s stock price swung from a deep loss to a gain of more than 10 percent, a swift recovery but one that erased only a small amount of the damage from a bruising week. Even after the rally on Thursday, First Republic has lost more than 70 percent of its market value this month, wiping roughly $16 billion from its valuation.A slew of other small banks, like Western Alliance and PacWest, were also lifted by the news of the intervention.\nDespite the broad rally on Thursday, the destabilizing volatility this week has investors braced for further stress in the financial system, stemming from the substantial shift away from a decade of low interest rates. Goldman Sachs, for example, has raised its odds that the U.S. economy could slip into recession over the next 12 months, \u201creflecting increased near-term uncertainty around the economic effects of small bank stress.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the recent bout of turmoil had served as a warning. \u201cUntil this week, markets had broadly ignored the threats that tightening policy was starting to uncover,\u201d she said.The broader recovery in the market on Thursday also lifted shares of energy companies, which had come under pressure following a swift slide in the price of oil on Wednesday. Oil prices, which are sensitive to the prospect of a global downturn sapping demand for the commodity, also rose slightly, but a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, the American benchmark, remained close to its lowest level since the end of 2021.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Broader markets had appeared more settled even before the news of the First Republic rescue. The S&P 500 remains up for the year and is on course to close out its second-best week of 2023, absent another reversal on Friday.Investors had largely shrugged off a 0.5 percentage point rate increase from the European Central Bank, taking solace from a rebound in the share price of Credit Suisse, the embattled European bank, after it said it would tap a lifeline from the Swiss central bank and borrow up to $54 billion.\nThe Stoxx 600 index, which tracks shares of the biggest companies in Europe, finished 1.2 percent higher, and shares of Credit Suisse jumped almost 20 percent, recovering some of the steep loss from the day before that stoked fear about the lender\u2019s financial health.Central banks have been raising interest rates to try to rein in inflation, but higher rates also mean higher costs for companies, contributing to the pain experienced by some banks in recent days.Policymakers must now balance the desire to continue slowing inflation with the potential for it to risk further instability in financial markets. Analysts noted that the E.C.B.\u2019s decision took on heightened importance ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting next week, and yields on U.S. government bonds rose, as investors leaned toward bets that the Fed would follow the E.C.B. in raising its benchmark rate next week.Still, traders in futures markets continued to bet that the Fed will cut interest rates later this year as inflation continues to fall and the economy continues to deteriorate, even though the central bank and its chair, Jerome H. Powell, have so far said that there are no plans to do so.\u201cThe balance of risks has undoubtedly shifted,\u201d noted Daleep Singh, the chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cThe risks from too much tightening are now at least equal to, and likely larger than, the risks of doing too little. We expect Fed Chair Powell to pair a final rate hike next week with a message that Fed policy will then go on an extended pause, with the possibility of resuming rate hikes later \u2014 or initiating rate cuts \u2014 in the second half of the year.\u201dJin Yu Young and Vivek Shankar contributed reporting.",

The central bank has been increasing borrowing costs since March of last year in an attempt to rein in economic activity and slow the pace of price increases.The numbers came amid some debate in markets over whether the Fed will have to continue with that campaign \u2014 in particular amid signs of a still healthy labor market and other factors that could inhibit policymakers\u2019 efforts to temper inflation. But Tuesday\u2019s report helped cement a view in financial markets that the Fed\u2019s efforts are working. \nThe government reported that the overall Consumer Price Index slowed to 3.2 percent last month on a year-over-year basis, lower than the 3.7 percent reading in September and the coolest since July.In the bond market, the two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in investors\u2019 interest rate expectations, slumped nearly 0.2 percentage points on Tuesday to around 4.85 percent \u2014 a huge move for an asset that typically rises and falls by hundredths of a percentage point.Alongside dialing down any likelihood that the Fed will surprise markets and still raise rates at its next meeting, in December, investors have also begun to bet on when the Fed will begin to lower interest rates. Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, recently said that decision was not even being considered by the central bank\u2019s officials as they looked to keep the brakes on the economy until inflation fell further toward their target of just 2 percent.\u201cThis takes a rate hike off the table in December and reinforces our call that July was the last hike of the cycle, and the process will now shift to the Fed attempting to delay cuts as long as possible,\u201d analysts at BMO Capital Markets noted.",

Tuesday\u2019s trading notched the worst single day for the S&P 500 since mid-December, helping to push the index to its worst weekly performance of the year: a decline of 2.7 percent.The turn in the market this month has come alongside a sharp reassessment among investors about what the Federal Reserve will have to do to lower inflation, and the damage that might inflict on companies, consumers and the economy.\nStock markets had rallied through January as investors pinned their hopes on a potential pause to the Fed\u2019s rate increases, after a sustained period of slowing inflation at the end of last year.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But that hope has been undone in recent weeks by data showing employers have kept hiring, consumers have kept spending and inflation has been re-accelerating. On Friday, the latest reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which the Fed tracks closely, showed inflation accelerating faster than expected in January.\u201cI think the market reaction we are seeing very clearly suggests investors think that the Fed has more work to do,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The Fed has been raising interest rates for almost a year, as it seeks to slow the economy and temper inflation. Higher interest rates also raise costs for companies, which typically weighs on stock prices.Investors have ratcheted up their forecasts for how many times the Fed will raise interest rates, this week cementing expectations for three quarter-point rate increases at the central bank\u2019s next three meetings. At the start of the month, investors expected just one more increase, at the meeting in March. They have even started to seriously price in the possibility that the Fed could go with a bigger increase in March, of half a point.\nIn response, bond yields have soared, with the two-year Treasury yield, a gauge of government borrowing costs that is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, reaching a post-pandemic peak on Friday. The yield rose more than a tenth of a percentage point, to 4.81 percent, its highest since 2007. That was a big move for an asset that usually rises and falls by hundredths of a point each day.The 10-year Treasury yield, which underpins borrowing costs across the globe, approached 4 percent, a threshold it hasn\u2019t risen above since November last year.Amid the volatility, investors have pulled cash from markets, withdrawing roughly $9 billion from funds that buy U.S. stocks in the seven days through Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global. That brought flows out of U.S. stocks for the past three weeks to almost $19 billion.The selling has been broad based, with every sector of the S&P 500 seeing losses so far this month. Technology stocks, which are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, outperformed at the start of the year, but that had begun to shift more recently. On Friday, the sector sank over 1.8 percent, underperforming the broader market.\u201cThe tug of war between bulls and bears has temporarily swung back in favor of the bears,\u201d said Mark Hackett, the chief of investment research at Nationwide.",

	"text": "Stocks dropped on Friday, signaling that investors had little confidence that the banking crisis had run its course despite moves to shore up flailing lenders with injections of tens of billions of dollars.The shares of many banks resumed their dizzying slide, erasing gains from Thursday that had provided a brief moment of calm during a tumultuous week. First Republic, the beleaguered regional lender, lost a third of its already beaten-down value on Friday alone. The S&P 500 stock index fell about 1.1 percent \u2014 the week\u2019s worst day of trading.President Biden asked Congress on Friday to grant financial regulators broad new powers to punish the executives of failed lenders. A day earlier, data showed that banks in the United States borrowed record amounts from the Federal Reserve this week to meet short-term needs, another sign of acute stresses in the financial system.The crisis was set in motion last week when clients of Silicon Valley Bank began to demand deposits as they worried about the losses the lender was taking on some investments. The run on deposits was too much, and regulators seized SVB.\nA second bank, Signature in New York, fell days later, providing the backdrop to a week of whipsaw trading that undermined confidence in the banking sector and prompted concerns about the effects on the economy.\u201cSentiment remains weak, and investor positioning remains conservative,\u201d said Mark Hackett, the chief of investment research at the insurance company Nationwide. \u201cHowever, investors should recognize that this is not a repeat of the financial crisis. It is disruptive for the industry and painful for a select group of banks and institutions, but the comparison to the financial crisis is premature.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Still, investors have begun to worry about the longer-term implications of financial turmoil, analysts said. Even if the small banks can remain solvent, a pullback in lending activity, if it came with the economy under pressure, could have broader implications, making cash less available to businesses when they might need it most. It also means less new business for the banks themselves, after a period when some lost sizable deposits.\u201cThe solvency concerns have not completely gone away,\u201d said Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar. \u201cBut even if you solve the concerns from a bank run, if a bank loses a large amount of its deposits and they don\u2019t return, then basically that bank has lost a large amount of its earnings potential.\u201dFirst Republic\u2019s shares fell more than 30 percent on Friday. Other regional banks also came under pressure, with PacWest and Western Alliance both falling between 15 and 20 percent. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank that received a multibillion-dollar rescue on Thursday, also lost ground in European trading.\nThe KBW bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 US banks, skidded more than 5 percent and has lost over 20 percent of its value this year, versus a small gain in the broader market over that period.\nOn Thursday, First Republic, whose stock price has cratered this month, announced a $30 billion rescue package funded by the largest banks in the United States. The bank also suspended its dividend and said it would take measures to reduce its debt.JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo agreed to each place $5 billion in uninsured deposits with First Republic. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, mainstays of Wall Street, pitched in $2.5 billion apiece, and five regional banks added $1 billion each.\nThe banks, normally fierce rivals, issued a joint statement explaining their move: \u201cAmerica\u2019s larger banks stand united with all banks to support our economy and all of those around us.\u201dThe deputy Treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, said on CNBC on Friday that U.S. officials were seeing deposit levels stabilizing in small and midsize banks, and in some cases modestly rising.\u201cThis was due in no small fact to the way that we resolved the two institutions that failed,\u201d he said, referring to the government takeovers of Silicon Valley Bank, a once-obscure lender to the tech world, and the small Signature Bank.But analysts at UBS wrote on Friday that investors were likely to see First Republic\u2019s rescue as a short-term fix and that banking stocks would \u201ctruly settle only after the market feels as if there is a longer-term solution\u201d to First Republic\u2019s woes. (The deposits given to First Republic from other banks are uninsured and for an initial term of 120 days.)Mr. Biden\u2019s appeal for legislation would expand the regulator powers held by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which took control of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature. The proposal would allow the agency to claw back compensation from executives of failed banks, as well as bar them from taking other jobs in the financial industry.\nOther signs of anxiety also persisted. Data from the Federal Reserve released on Thursday showed that banks borrowed record amounts of emergency funds from the central bank in recent days, tapping both existing facilities and a new program to shore up liquidity that was announced after the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature.\u201cThis has given me more conviction on my negative view, but I don\u2019t think the world is falling apart,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.The events of the past week, Ms. Shah added, may have brought forward the timeline in which the economy slips into recession. \u201cThe concern is what else will be unearthed? What else is out there?\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Alan Rappeport, Keith Bradsher, Rob Copeland and Lauren Hirsch.",

	"text": "Stocks in Hong Kong entered a bear market on Friday, down 21 percent from their high near the start of the year, as investors around the world grew increasingly worried that the deteriorating condition of China\u2019s real estate sector could spill over into the broader economy.The slump in the Hang Seng Index, which is made up mostly of companies from China\u2019s mainland, comes as the country\u2019s economy confronts weakening growth. After three years of harsh Covid restrictions, foreign investment is down, consumers are spending less and the housing market is in turmoil.Bear markets, when stocks drop at least 20 percent from their most recent peak, are a relatively rare signal that investors view the economy with serious pessimism. The Hang Seng fell just over 2 percent on Friday, and about 6 percent for the week. The index is down more than 10 percent so far this month.Global investors are also wary of the effects of China\u2019s weakening economy, which has added to worries about inflation and high interest rates in Europe and the United States. On Friday, European stocks mostly fell and the S&P 500 was flat. The U.S. benchmark index is on track to record its third consecutive weekly decline.\nA small rise in oil prices on Friday, to about $81 per barrel, was not enough to reverse the first weekly decline since June for West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which underpins borrowing costs across the economy, slipped on Friday to about 4.2 percent, after touching its highest level since 2007 a day earlier.\u201cMarkets are being hit by the perfect storm,\u201d analysts at Barclays wrote in a report on Friday, citing rising interest rates, grim economic data in China and other factors.A real estate crisis is at the heart of the concerns over China. Among the companies hit hardest recently is the Chinese real estate giant Country Garden, whose shares are trading well below one Hong Kong dollar. Another behemoth developer, China Evergrande, sought bankruptcy protection in the United States on Thursday as it struggled to settle with creditors over tens of billions of dollars in debt.Highlighting the depths of the downturn, Soho China, a Hong Kong-listed developer of office buildings in mainland China, on Friday reported a plunge in first-half profit of more than 90 percent. The company said in a statement that \u201cmarket confidence was yet to be restored.\u201dChinese stocks had bounced after officials in December lifted the government\u2019s extreme \u201czero Covid\u201d measures that sharply curtailed economic activity. But hopes that China\u2019s economy would show a sustained recovery faded as the country released a string of concerning economic statistics. Prices fell, raising the threat of deflation; retail sales and industrial production missed economists\u2019 expectations; and real estate investments dwindled.\nExports, a cornerstone of China\u2019s economy, have fallen. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has sunk to its lowest level in years. A number of major banks have downgraded their forecasts for how much China\u2019s economy will grow in 2023, to levels below the government\u2019s target of about 5 percent. The most recent official numbers indicate that China was growing at an annual growth rate of about 3 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.China\u2019s policymakers have responded with a series of measures aimed at encouraging consumers to spend more and banks to step up their lending. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has cut key interest rates to new lows, while securities regulators have proposed ways to make trading stocks cheaper and easier. But the moves have done little to bolster the confidence of investors or generate greater economy activity.\nOne problem weighing heavily on China is debt, particularly at local governments that depend greatly on the real estate market. Overall debt in China is now larger, relative to national economic output, than in the United States.And so the stock market has lost steam. In Hong Kong, stocks have declined for six consecutive days, and eight of the past 10 trading sessions.\nStocks have also tumbled in mainland China. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, has dropped about 10 percent since its January high.The situation for investors is brighter in the United States, where the S&P 500 index, even after recent declines, is up about 14 percent this year, buoyed by optimism about technology \u2014 especially the prospects for artificial intelligence, and the chip makers that power those applications \u2014 and the resilience of consumer spending.Still, the benchmark index has shed about 5 percent of its value this month, chipping away at the gains recorded in recent months. \u201cThe U.S. economy remains strong, while China continues disappointing at the margin and global investors are becoming increasingly concerned,\u201d Claudio Irigoyen, an economist at Bank of America, wrote in a report. This \u201cdecoupling\u201d could eventually \u201ccontaminate sentiment\u201d enough to precipitate a sharper fall in global markets, he added.J. Edward Moreno contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After a tumultuous couple of days, stock markets in the United States were poised to rise on Monday as regulators moved to limit the contagion from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Futures contracts on the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 percent overnight, while those on the Nasdaq climbed 1.7 percent.In Asia, most stock markets were off their lows by Monday afternoon. Officials in Japan, South Korea and India, some of the largest economies in the region, assuaged concerns of a global ripple effect emanating from the United States.The worries had been centered on the banking system, which in the past year has had to contend with rising interest rates. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, its investment strategy based on rates became a money loser, leading to the lender\u2019s demise.\nNow, investors expect the Federal Reserve to change its approach to raising interest rates, a move that could ease pressure on banks.\u201cMarkets are pricing for a pause in rate hikes in March,\u201d said Tina Teng, an analyst with CMC Markets in Auckland, New Zealand. Investors, she added, believe that U.S. authorities can contain the risk in the banking system.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index was down 1.4 percent, while the South Korean benchmark erased losses and was up 0.5 percent. Indexes in greater China were outliers, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rising more than 2 percent after China\u2019s central bank governor, Yi Gang, was reappointed to the job in a surprise move.Silicon Valley Bank is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., and had been a favored lender of the region\u2019s start-ups. Its troubles came to light after another bank\u2019s collapse: Silvergate, a California-based bank that made loans to cryptocurrency companies, announced Wednesday that it would cease operations and liquidate its assets.On Friday, regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank, guaranteeing that deposits of up to $250,000 were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as is the norm. But there was concern that many of the bank\u2019s clients would be on the hook for losses because the bank had many accounts over that limit.\nThen on Sunday, the Fed, the Treasury and the F.D.I.C. issued a joint statement, saying that \u201cdepositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.\u201d The regulators stressed that \u201cno losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.\u201d Also on Sunday, regulators shut down Signature Bank in New York.The Fed is also setting up an emergency lending program, with approval from the Treasury, to funnel funding to eligible banks so they can \u201cmeet the needs of all their depositors.\u201dOne early beneficiary was San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, which on Sunday said that it received additional funding from the Fed and the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.",

	"text": "This summer, when Hong Kong\u2019s stock market rout seemed to have no end in sight, the city\u2019s financial chief, Paul Chan, jumped into action, creating a task force to inject confidence into a market that was being pummeled by global investors wary of China.Hong Kong cut taxes on trading, and Mr. Chan went on a roadshow to Europe and the United States, promising measures to \u201clet investors feel optimistic about the outlook.\u201d Investors were anything but sanguine, however, and the city\u2019s stock exchange is among the world\u2019s worst-performing stock markets this year.The Hang Seng Index finished Friday, its last trading day in 2023, 14 percent lower than it started the year. Stocks in mainland China also recorded losses this year, with the CSI 300, an index that tracks companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, declining 11 percent.Hundreds of billions of dollars flowed out this year as money managers and pension funds reduced their holdings in Hong Kong, which has long been a gateway for foreign investors wanting to put money into mainland China. The outflows were largely driven by an economic downturn in China and mounting pressure on American investors to sell their exposure to Chinese companies.\n\u201cMany of the companies in the Hang Seng Index are essentially companies that are leveraged to economic growth in China,\u201d said Chetan Seth, an Asia equity strategist at Nomura, a Japanese bank. \u201cChina\u2019s weak economy clearly has weighed on the performance of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong,\u201d Mr. Seth said.\nThe losses in Hong Kong and the mainland contrasted sharply to what happened in the United States, where inflation eased and the job market was strong. The S&P 500, which broadly tracks U.S. stocks, was up 25 percent in 2023, underlining the divergent paths of the world\u2019s two largest economies.Global investors started the year optimistic that China\u2019s economy would bounce back after three years of strict pandemic rules and lockdowns. But when China fully opened its borders in January for the first time since 2020, many households were reluctant to spend. Private businesses floundered, and the economy slowed.\nChina\u2019s roiling property crisis has intensified the economic slump and spilled over into Hong Kong. After years of overexpansion and borrowing from foreign investors in Hong Kong, nearly every private Chinese real estate developer has collapsed.Chinese property companies listed in Hong Kong were among the worst-performing stocks. The real estate developer Country Garden, one of the biggest casualties of the property crisis, has lost nearly three-quarters of its value this year as it edges closer to a collapse.Mr. Chan, the finance secretary, has blamed \u201cmisunderstandings caused by Western political prejudices\u201d for the stock market\u2019s poor performance, as geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington hit a low point during the year. But 2023 was the fourth consecutive year that the Hang Seng recorded losses. Over that same time, Hong Kong\u2019s role as a financial nerve center for Asia diminished as it was forced to align more closely with Beijing under a far-reaching national security law.\nHong Kong\u2019s loss of autonomy to China has worried some global investors.A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 with a pledge that it would maintain a high degree of self-governance under a policy called \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d For two decades, this allowed Hong Kong to define itself as unique and distinct from the rest of China, while offering financial access to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\nBut after citywide protests in 2019, Beijing imposed the national security law, which has silenced political debate and stifled civic activity.More than 100,000 residents have left Hong Kong over the last few years, in part because of the security law and tough pandemic restrictions. Many young Hong Kong professionals who are still there have expressed a desire to leave, making it a challenge to recruit the talent that has helped the city function as a financial center.Once a major hub for Wall Street banks, Hong Kong had a drought of initial public offerings this year. Companies raised the lowest amount of money since 2001, resulting in layoffs at financial institutions citywide.Many international companies have stopped hiring for new positions in Hong Kong. With less money coming into the exchange and fewer transactions, dozens of brokerages have also closed.China\u2019s downturn, geopolitics, elections in major economies including the United States and the actions of central banks are all likely to make 2024 another volatile year for Hong Kong.Addressing some of these issues in an interview in a recent interview with the South China Morning Post, Mr. Chan said, \u201c2024 will be a year of high uncertainty.\u201d",

	"text": "Heat, drought, flood and famine. Evidence of climate change is all around us.If the planet is to avoid even more severe consequences from global warming, the world\u2019s leading energy agency says, consumption of oil, coal and natural gas needs to be reduced much more rapidly, and clean energy sources like wind and solar power need to expand at a far faster pace.But the stock market doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten the memo.Instead, the shares of a broad range of clean energy companies have been crushed lately, in a rout that encompasses just about every alternative energy sector, including solar, wind and geothermal power.At the same time, rather than weaning themselves off oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two biggest U.S. oil companies, are doubling down. They have announced acquisitions that will vastly increase their oil reserves. Exxon intends to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a major shale drilling company, for $59.5 billion. Chevron plans a $53 billion purchase of Hess, a big integrated oil company. These are enormous bets on oil for years to come.It\u2019s a perplexing state of affairs. The evidence that carbon emissions are warming the planet is persuasive. Yet the stock market, which is supposed to be forward-looking, is treating alternative energy companies with disdain and big oil companies with respect.\nThere\u2019s something wrong here, obviously.I think the problem resides with the stock market, not the scientists.Benjamin Graham, the great value investor and Columbia professor, once said, \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201dThat means that eventually the market gets things right, but in the short run, it\u2019s prone to enthusiasms, snap judgments and myopic thinking.That seems to be what\u2019s happening now.The Big Picture\nThe scientific consensus is clear. It sometimes seems there is a new and compelling study on climate change, with disturbing conclusions, every day.\nLast month, for example, in its latest comprehensive report on the world\u2019s chances of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2050, the International Energy Agency, the world\u2019s leading energy authority, said the climate was warming all too rapidly. The probability of a benign outcome is receding, it said, yet odds will improve if the world shifts aggressively from fossil to alternative fuels.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.In a separate study released this past week, a group of scientists said the planet probably had only a little over five years before global warming would exceed the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement: warming of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above temperatures that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution.Breach that limit and there will be catastrophes far worse than what we have experienced so far, the study said. Already, the planet has warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius. Governments, companies and consumers around the world need to take aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions immediately, the study said.If the stock market heeded such calls to action, you might expect that the alternative energy shares would be booming and that big oil companies would be pouring most of their money into renewable resources.But in its collective wisdom, the stock market seems to be embracing a different and contrary vision.\nStock LossesHundreds of billions of dollars are, in fact, being invested in renewable energy projects, even if the stock market generally isn\u2019t favoring them right now.The returns are ugly. The iShares Global Clean Energy E.T.F., an exchange-traded fund that tracks the entire industry, is down more than 30 percent this year. Even worse, since the start of 2021, it has lost more than 50 percent.Narrower sectors are being punished, too. The Invesco Solar E.T.F. is down more than 40 percent this year and almost 60 percent since Jan. 1, 2021. The First Trust Global Wind Energy E.T.F. has lost about 20 percent this year and about 40 percent since Jan. 1, 2021.Rising interest rates have increased costs and tempered consumer enthusiasm in many countries, reducing stock valuations for fast-growing companies that aren\u2019t churning out big profits. Renewable energy companies have been hard hit.\nSolarEdge, which provides equipment needed to convert energy from solar panels into power that can be transmitted through electric grids, warned on Oct. 17 that demand for its products was lagging. The market responded harshly.\nShares of the company, which is based in Israel, dropped nearly 30 percent in a single day. A host of other solar companies followed. Enphase Energy, a rival firm in Fremont, Calif., has lost almost 40 percent since Oct. 17.Wind energy companies haven\u2019t been spared, either. Shares of Orsted, the Danish wind turbine company, fell nearly 26 percent on Wednesday after it said it might have to write down as much as $5.6 billion on the value of its offshore wind projects in the United States.One Orsted venture, South Fork Wind, a set of turbines being installed 30 miles east of Montauk Point, is scheduled to start sending electricity to Long Island before the end of the year. But the company canceled two projects, known as Ocean Wind 1 and 2, that were to supply New Jersey with green energy, and some of its projects for New York and Connecticut have run into trouble, too.In October, New York State\u2019s Public Service Commission rejected requests from Orsted and several other companies \u2014 including BP and Equinor \u2014 for billions in electric rate increases to help defray their ballooning costs. The companies say that with inflation and higher interest rates increasing their costs, the viability of some of their projects in the New York metropolitan area is in doubt.\nBetting on Fossil FuelBig oil company profits and revenue have flagged since last year, when energy prices soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.For the entire S&P 500, earnings per share in the third quarter grew only 2.7 percent from a year earlier, John Butters, a senior earnings analyst for FactSet, estimated. Exclude the big energy companies, though, and that total increased to 8.4 percent. That\u2019s because earnings per share for big, fossil fuel energy companies declined 38.1 percent, more than for any other sector.Oil prices are volatile, and their trajectory in the years ahead is far from certain. But Exxon and Chevron are staking their futures on oil. Exxon\u2019s acquisition of Pioneer would be its biggest purchase since it bought Mobil in 1999. And Chevron will deepen its commitment to oil by acquiring Hess.Though I know better, I can\u2019t stop thinking of Hess as \u201cthe green company.\u201d That\u2019s only because I\u2019m an old New York Jets fan. Hess shares corporate history and a green-and-white motif with the Jets. Leon Hess founded the company, owned the team and liked the color green. But the Hess product line is petroleum-based. It\u2019s not a green company otherwise.\nBut no matter. Oil has been good to Hess\u2019s shareholders, and to shareholders of the three other companies. Over the last three years, Exxon has returned about 275 percent, including dividends; Chevron, 135 percent; Pioneer, 260 percent; and Hess, a whopping 310 percent. The S&P 500 returned about 32 percent.As long as the world consumes oil, companies like these will be profitable, or so oil bulls say.Plus, there is a wild card.As the World Bank warned on Monday, if the war between Israel and Hamas widens, conflict in the Middle East could easily set off a steep surge in oil prices. An escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian war could make oil soar as well. So could any number of potential military or political conflicts.If scientific findings dominate, oil could become a stranded asset, one that can\u2019t be sold. But the market consensus is that the viable life of Big Oil has a long way to go.Confounding ChoicesWhat are we to make of the messages the market is sending?For one thing, I wouldn\u2019t view them as inevitable. Prices shift every minute, and despite its vaunted reputation, the stock market doesn\u2019t provide a guide to the future. Sometimes it can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of it, and it certainly can\u2019t see around corners. I remain hopeful, despite discouraging tidings from the stock market.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t dismiss the stock market\u2019s signals entirely. Market prices incorporate the views of an awful lot of people who can\u2019t agree on much, except, at a particular moment, on the appropriate price for a specific offering. In that sense, the market is, as Benjamin Graham said, a voting machine.Pouring money into unprofitable ventures isn\u2019t a good strategy unless those ventures ultimately generate a great deal of cash. The jury is still out on many alternative energy companies, much as the world needs their products. Oil companies, on the other hand, are prized for their ability to gush cash.But if you\u2019re seeking a guide to the future, don\u2019t count on the stock market. I expect it to rise over the long run, and to make fickle and foolish choices along the way.",

	"text": "Wall Street\u2019s longest weekly winning streak in almost 20 years came to an end on Friday, as stock investors\u2019 celebrations over slowing inflation and the potential for cuts to interest rates were replaced with caution over the lingering risks to the economy.The S&P 500 index ended the week with a loss of 1.5 percent. It was the first weekly drop after nine straight weeks of gains \u2014 the market\u2019s longest winning streak since January 2004. The Nasdaq Composite, chock-full of tech stocks that soared in 2023, has also drifted lower.Analysts and investors said that for the time being the moves signaled only a mild pullback, rather than the start of a more severe downturn. Investors\u2019 unbridled optimism had pushed the S&P 500 almost 14 percent higher in the final two months of the year, to within a whisker of a new high.Alongside caution that stock market valuations had risen too far too quickly, investors\u2019 newfound sobriety was underpinned by a reassessment of when the Federal Reserve would begin to lower interest rates \u2014 cuts that could bolster stock prices, corporate profits and consumer spending. Heading into the end of 2023, investors were betting that rate cuts could start as soon as March.\n\u201cThe market has got a bit ahead of itself,\u201d Cayla Seder, a macro strategist at State Street, said, noting the risk that the slowdown in inflation could still reverse course. \u201cThere was so much optimism going into the end of the year.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Minutes of the Fed\u2019s last meeting in December, released on Wednesday, confirmed perceptions that the central bank\u2019s stance has shifted, with policymakers acknowledging a slowdown in inflation that probably means an end to further interest rate increases. But the minutes suggested policymakers are intent on keeping rates elevated until they are more confident that inflation is under control, putting pressure on the bets of a rate cut in the coming months. That, in turn, has weighed on stocks.On Friday, new data showed that the labor market remained strong in December, cementing confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience but also stoking concerns that inflation could yet reignite as wages continued to rise. The S&P 500 ended the day about 0.2 percent higher, though that was not enough to reverse the losses earlier in the week.The early slide marks the S&P 500\u2019s worst start to a year since 2015, though analysts cautioned about drawing strong conclusions from just four days of trading.Many of the stocks that propelled the market higher last year have been the anchor weighing it down in 2024. All of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which include the biggest companies in the market that have an outsized impact on returns, rank among the worst performers for the week.\nCollectively, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) and Meta (Facebook\u2019s parent) are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the S&P 500\u2019s drop since Jan. 2. Without them, the index would have fallen less than 1 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Apple, down about 6 percent since last Friday, has come under sustained pressure after two analysts downgraded their outlook for the company, pointing to falling iPhone sales that have contributed to contracting revenues.Some analysts say stock prices could fall further. While investors have dialed down bets on a rate cut coming in March, they are still expecting that a gradual slowdown in the economy will give the Fed license to cut borrowing costs by 0.75 percentage points by the end of July \u2014 as much as the central bank forecast in December for the whole of 2024.If the economy proves stronger than anticipated, the central bank is likely to hold rates higher for longer, disappointing investors. A sharp deterioration in the health of the economy could result in rate cuts, but for more worrying reasons.\u201cIt\u2019s all very Goldilocks,\u201d said George Goncalves, chief macro strategist at MUFG Securities. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d\nA rise in longer-term borrowing costs, underpinned by the rate paid on government bonds, could also unsettle stock investors, after a stunning rally late last year dragged the yield on the 10-year Treasury down by roughly a percentage point to around 4 percent. Some bond traders surveyed by J.P. Morgan went into this week betting on a reversal of some of that move, and Friday\u2019s jobs data has already helped to push yields higher.\u201cOne of the big risks of leaning into a Fed relief rally is that after a couple of months, investors usually realize that the Fed is pulling back on interest rate hiking policy because they are seeing growth slow,\u201d which tends to be \u201cless constructive\u201d for the stock market, said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.For many analysts, though, a modest pullback in the market was warranted after the searing rally at the end of 2023, with most stock market prognosticators still forecasting a rise in the S&P 500 over the next year.Roger Aliaga-Diaz, an economist at Vanguard, said the balance of risk had tilted toward a \u201crosy scenario\u201d while \u201cignoring all the risks that are, in our view, still there.\u201d\u201cWe are not out of the woods in terms of inflation,\u201d he warned.",

	"text": "The week\u2019s dizzying swings in financial markets continued on Thursday, as investors welcomed a group of big banks stepping in to support their smaller peer First Republic Bank, helping ease some of the turmoil emanating from regional lenders.The S&P 500 rose 1.8 percent, after recovering from an early drop, in a rally that gained steam after news that a group of 11 banks would deposit a combined $30 billion with First Republic, which has come into investors\u2019 cross hairs after the failure of Silicon Valley Bank.First Republic\u2019s stock price swung from a deep loss to a gain of more than 10 percent, a swift recovery but one that erased only a small amount of the damage from a bruising week. Even after the rally on Thursday, First Republic has lost more than 70 percent of its market value this month, wiping roughly $16 billion from its valuation.A slew of other small banks, like Western Alliance and PacWest, were also lifted by the news of the intervention.\nDespite the broad rally on Thursday, the destabilizing volatility this week has investors braced for further stress in the financial system, stemming from the substantial shift away from a decade of low interest rates. Goldman Sachs, for example, has raised its odds that the U.S. economy could slip into recession over the next 12 months, \u201creflecting increased near-term uncertainty around the economic effects of small bank stress.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Seema Shah, the chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management, said the recent bout of turmoil had served as a warning. \u201cUntil this week, markets had broadly ignored the threats that tightening policy was starting to uncover,\u201d she said.The broader recovery in the market on Thursday also lifted shares of energy companies, which had come under pressure following a swift slide in the price of oil on Wednesday. Oil prices, which are sensitive to the prospect of a global downturn sapping demand for the commodity, also rose slightly, but a barrel of West Texas Intermediate crude, the American benchmark, remained close to its lowest level since the end of 2021.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Broader markets had appeared more settled even before the news of the First Republic rescue. The S&P 500 remains up for the year and is on course to close out its second-best week of 2023, absent another reversal on Friday.Investors had largely shrugged off a 0.5 percentage point rate increase from the European Central Bank, taking solace from a rebound in the share price of Credit Suisse, the embattled European bank, after it said it would tap a lifeline from the Swiss central bank and borrow up to $54 billion.\nThe Stoxx 600 index, which tracks shares of the biggest companies in Europe, finished 1.2 percent higher, and shares of Credit Suisse jumped almost 20 percent, recovering some of the steep loss from the day before that stoked fear about the lender\u2019s financial health.Central banks have been raising interest rates to try to rein in inflation, but higher rates also mean higher costs for companies, contributing to the pain experienced by some banks in recent days.Policymakers must now balance the desire to continue slowing inflation with the potential for it to risk further instability in financial markets. Analysts noted that the E.C.B.\u2019s decision took on heightened importance ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting next week, and yields on U.S. government bonds rose, as investors leaned toward bets that the Fed would follow the E.C.B. in raising its benchmark rate next week.Still, traders in futures markets continued to bet that the Fed will cut interest rates later this year as inflation continues to fall and the economy continues to deteriorate, even though the central bank and its chair, Jerome H. Powell, have so far said that there are no plans to do so.\u201cThe balance of risks has undoubtedly shifted,\u201d noted Daleep Singh, the chief global economist at PGIM Fixed Income. \u201cThe risks from too much tightening are now at least equal to, and likely larger than, the risks of doing too little. We expect Fed Chair Powell to pair a final rate hike next week with a message that Fed policy will then go on an extended pause, with the possibility of resuming rate hikes later \u2014 or initiating rate cuts \u2014 in the second half of the year.\u201dJin Yu Young and Vivek Shankar contributed reporting.",

The central bank has been increasing borrowing costs since March of last year in an attempt to rein in economic activity and slow the pace of price increases.The numbers came amid some debate in markets over whether the Fed will have to continue with that campaign \u2014 in particular amid signs of a still healthy labor market and other factors that could inhibit policymakers\u2019 efforts to temper inflation. But Tuesday\u2019s report helped cement a view in financial markets that the Fed\u2019s efforts are working. \nThe government reported that the overall Consumer Price Index slowed to 3.2 percent last month on a year-over-year basis, lower than the 3.7 percent reading in September and the coolest since July.In the bond market, the two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in investors\u2019 interest rate expectations, slumped nearly 0.2 percentage points on Tuesday to around 4.85 percent \u2014 a huge move for an asset that typically rises and falls by hundredths of a percentage point.Alongside dialing down any likelihood that the Fed will surprise markets and still raise rates at its next meeting, in December, investors have also begun to bet on when the Fed will begin to lower interest rates. Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, recently said that decision was not even being considered by the central bank\u2019s officials as they looked to keep the brakes on the economy until inflation fell further toward their target of just 2 percent.\u201cThis takes a rate hike off the table in December and reinforces our call that July was the last hike of the cycle, and the process will now shift to the Fed attempting to delay cuts as long as possible,\u201d analysts at BMO Capital Markets noted.",

	"text": "Stocks slumped Friday to cap their worst week of the year, as investors balked at fresh government data that added to a flurry of signals showing a resurgence in inflation.The S&P 500 fell 1.1 percent by the end of the trading day, adding to losses earlier in the week and recording its third straight week of declines.That came in a shortened week, with markets closed on Monday for the Presidents\u2019 Day holiday. Tuesday\u2019s trading notched the worst single day for the S&P 500 since mid-December, helping to push the index to its worst weekly performance of the year: a decline of 2.7 percent.The turn in the market this month has come alongside a sharp reassessment among investors about what the Federal Reserve will have to do to lower inflation, and the damage that might inflict on companies, consumers and the economy.\nStock markets had rallied through January as investors pinned their hopes on a potential pause to the Fed\u2019s rate increases, after a sustained period of slowing inflation at the end of last year.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.But that hope has been undone in recent weeks by data showing employers have kept hiring, consumers have kept spending and inflation has been re-accelerating. On Friday, the latest reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which the Fed tracks closely, showed inflation accelerating faster than expected in January.\u201cI think the market reaction we are seeing very clearly suggests investors think that the Fed has more work to do,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The Fed has been raising interest rates for almost a year, as it seeks to slow the economy and temper inflation. Higher interest rates also raise costs for companies, which typically weighs on stock prices.Investors have ratcheted up their forecasts for how many times the Fed will raise interest rates, this week cementing expectations for three quarter-point rate increases at the central bank\u2019s next three meetings. At the start of the month, investors expected just one more increase, at the meeting in March. They have even started to seriously price in the possibility that the Fed could go with a bigger increase in March, of half a point.\nIn response, bond yields have soared, with the two-year Treasury yield, a gauge of government borrowing costs that is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, reaching a post-pandemic peak on Friday. The yield rose more than a tenth of a percentage point, to 4.81 percent, its highest since 2007. That was a big move for an asset that usually rises and falls by hundredths of a point each day.The 10-year Treasury yield, which underpins borrowing costs across the globe, approached 4 percent, a threshold it hasn\u2019t risen above since November last year.Amid the volatility, investors have pulled cash from markets, withdrawing roughly $9 billion from funds that buy U.S. stocks in the seven days through Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global. That brought flows out of U.S. stocks for the past three weeks to almost $19 billion.The selling has been broad based, with every sector of the S&P 500 seeing losses so far this month. Technology stocks, which are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates, outperformed at the start of the year, but that had begun to shift more recently. On Friday, the sector sank over 1.8 percent, underperforming the broader market.\u201cThe tug of war between bulls and bears has temporarily swung back in favor of the bears,\u201d said Mark Hackett, the chief of investment research at Nationwide.",

	"text": "Stocks dropped on Friday, signaling that investors had little confidence that the banking crisis had run its course despite moves to shore up flailing lenders with injections of tens of billions of dollars.The shares of many banks resumed their dizzying slide, erasing gains from Thursday that had provided a brief moment of calm during a tumultuous week. First Republic, the beleaguered regional lender, lost a third of its already beaten-down value on Friday alone. The S&P 500 stock index fell about 1.1 percent \u2014 the week\u2019s worst day of trading.President Biden asked Congress on Friday to grant financial regulators broad new powers to punish the executives of failed lenders. A day earlier, data showed that banks in the United States borrowed record amounts from the Federal Reserve this week to meet short-term needs, another sign of acute stresses in the financial system.The crisis was set in motion last week when clients of Silicon Valley Bank began to demand deposits as they worried about the losses the lender was taking on some investments. The run on deposits was too much, and regulators seized SVB.\nA second bank, Signature in New York, fell days later, providing the backdrop to a week of whipsaw trading that undermined confidence in the banking sector and prompted concerns about the effects on the economy.\u201cSentiment remains weak, and investor positioning remains conservative,\u201d said Mark Hackett, the chief of investment research at the insurance company Nationwide. \u201cHowever, investors should recognize that this is not a repeat of the financial crisis. It is disruptive for the industry and painful for a select group of banks and institutions, but the comparison to the financial crisis is premature.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Still, investors have begun to worry about the longer-term implications of financial turmoil, analysts said. Even if the small banks can remain solvent, a pullback in lending activity, if it came with the economy under pressure, could have broader implications, making cash less available to businesses when they might need it most. It also means less new business for the banks themselves, after a period when some lost sizable deposits.\u201cThe solvency concerns have not completely gone away,\u201d said Michael Wong, an analyst at Morningstar. \u201cBut even if you solve the concerns from a bank run, if a bank loses a large amount of its deposits and they don\u2019t return, then basically that bank has lost a large amount of its earnings potential.\u201dFirst Republic\u2019s shares fell more than 30 percent on Friday. Other regional banks also came under pressure, with PacWest and Western Alliance both falling between 15 and 20 percent. Credit Suisse, the Swiss bank that received a multibillion-dollar rescue on Thursday, also lost ground in European trading.\nThe KBW bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 US banks, skidded more than 5 percent and has lost over 20 percent of its value this year, versus a small gain in the broader market over that period.\nOn Thursday, First Republic, whose stock price has cratered this month, announced a $30 billion rescue package funded by the largest banks in the United States. The bank also suspended its dividend and said it would take measures to reduce its debt.JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo agreed to each place $5 billion in uninsured deposits with First Republic. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, mainstays of Wall Street, pitched in $2.5 billion apiece, and five regional banks added $1 billion each.\nThe banks, normally fierce rivals, issued a joint statement explaining their move: \u201cAmerica\u2019s larger banks stand united with all banks to support our economy and all of those around us.\u201dThe deputy Treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, said on CNBC on Friday that U.S. officials were seeing deposit levels stabilizing in small and midsize banks, and in some cases modestly rising.\u201cThis was due in no small fact to the way that we resolved the two institutions that failed,\u201d he said, referring to the government takeovers of Silicon Valley Bank, a once-obscure lender to the tech world, and the small Signature Bank.But analysts at UBS wrote on Friday that investors were likely to see First Republic\u2019s rescue as a short-term fix and that banking stocks would \u201ctruly settle only after the market feels as if there is a longer-term solution\u201d to First Republic\u2019s woes. (The deposits given to First Republic from other banks are uninsured and for an initial term of 120 days.)Mr. Biden\u2019s appeal for legislation would expand the regulator powers held by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which took control of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature. The proposal would allow the agency to claw back compensation from executives of failed banks, as well as bar them from taking other jobs in the financial industry.\nOther signs of anxiety also persisted. Data from the Federal Reserve released on Thursday showed that banks borrowed record amounts of emergency funds from the central bank in recent days, tapping both existing facilities and a new program to shore up liquidity that was announced after the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature.\u201cThis has given me more conviction on my negative view, but I don\u2019t think the world is falling apart,\u201d said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.The events of the past week, Ms. Shah added, may have brought forward the timeline in which the economy slips into recession. \u201cThe concern is what else will be unearthed? What else is out there?\u201d she said.Reporting was contributed by Alan Rappeport, Keith Bradsher, Rob Copeland and Lauren Hirsch.",

	"text": "Stocks in Hong Kong entered a bear market on Friday, down 21 percent from their high near the start of the year, as investors around the world grew increasingly worried that the deteriorating condition of China\u2019s real estate sector could spill over into the broader economy.The slump in the Hang Seng Index, which is made up mostly of companies from China\u2019s mainland, comes as the country\u2019s economy confronts weakening growth. After three years of harsh Covid restrictions, foreign investment is down, consumers are spending less and the housing market is in turmoil.Bear markets, when stocks drop at least 20 percent from their most recent peak, are a relatively rare signal that investors view the economy with serious pessimism. The Hang Seng fell just over 2 percent on Friday, and about 6 percent for the week. The index is down more than 10 percent so far this month.Global investors are also wary of the effects of China\u2019s weakening economy, which has added to worries about inflation and high interest rates in Europe and the United States. On Friday, European stocks mostly fell and the S&P 500 was flat. The U.S. benchmark index is on track to record its third consecutive weekly decline.\nA small rise in oil prices on Friday, to about $81 per barrel, was not enough to reverse the first weekly decline since June for West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond, which underpins borrowing costs across the economy, slipped on Friday to about 4.2 percent, after touching its highest level since 2007 a day earlier.\u201cMarkets are being hit by the perfect storm,\u201d analysts at Barclays wrote in a report on Friday, citing rising interest rates, grim economic data in China and other factors.A real estate crisis is at the heart of the concerns over China. Among the companies hit hardest recently is the Chinese real estate giant Country Garden, whose shares are trading well below one Hong Kong dollar. Another behemoth developer, China Evergrande, sought bankruptcy protection in the United States on Thursday as it struggled to settle with creditors over tens of billions of dollars in debt.Highlighting the depths of the downturn, Soho China, a Hong Kong-listed developer of office buildings in mainland China, on Friday reported a plunge in first-half profit of more than 90 percent. The company said in a statement that \u201cmarket confidence was yet to be restored.\u201dChinese stocks had bounced after officials in December lifted the government\u2019s extreme \u201czero Covid\u201d measures that sharply curtailed economic activity. But hopes that China\u2019s economy would show a sustained recovery faded as the country released a string of concerning economic statistics. Prices fell, raising the threat of deflation; retail sales and industrial production missed economists\u2019 expectations; and real estate investments dwindled.\nExports, a cornerstone of China\u2019s economy, have fallen. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has sunk to its lowest level in years. A number of major banks have downgraded their forecasts for how much China\u2019s economy will grow in 2023, to levels below the government\u2019s target of about 5 percent. The most recent official numbers indicate that China was growing at an annual growth rate of about 3 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.China\u2019s policymakers have responded with a series of measures aimed at encouraging consumers to spend more and banks to step up their lending. The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, has cut key interest rates to new lows, while securities regulators have proposed ways to make trading stocks cheaper and easier. But the moves have done little to bolster the confidence of investors or generate greater economy activity.\nOne problem weighing heavily on China is debt, particularly at local governments that depend greatly on the real estate market. Overall debt in China is now larger, relative to national economic output, than in the United States.And so the stock market has lost steam. In Hong Kong, stocks have declined for six consecutive days, and eight of the past 10 trading sessions.\nStocks have also tumbled in mainland China. The CSI 300 index, which tracks the biggest companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, has dropped about 10 percent since its January high.The situation for investors is brighter in the United States, where the S&P 500 index, even after recent declines, is up about 14 percent this year, buoyed by optimism about technology \u2014 especially the prospects for artificial intelligence, and the chip makers that power those applications \u2014 and the resilience of consumer spending.Still, the benchmark index has shed about 5 percent of its value this month, chipping away at the gains recorded in recent months. \u201cThe U.S. economy remains strong, while China continues disappointing at the margin and global investors are becoming increasingly concerned,\u201d Claudio Irigoyen, an economist at Bank of America, wrote in a report. This \u201cdecoupling\u201d could eventually \u201ccontaminate sentiment\u201d enough to precipitate a sharper fall in global markets, he added.J. Edward Moreno contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After a tumultuous couple of days, stock markets in the United States were poised to rise on Monday as regulators moved to limit the contagion from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.Futures contracts on the S&P 500 climbed 1.6 percent overnight, while those on the Nasdaq climbed 1.7 percent.In Asia, most stock markets were off their lows by Monday afternoon. Officials in Japan, South Korea and India, some of the largest economies in the region, assuaged concerns of a global ripple effect emanating from the United States.The worries had been centered on the banking system, which in the past year has had to contend with rising interest rates. In the case of Silicon Valley Bank, its investment strategy based on rates became a money loser, leading to the lender\u2019s demise.\nNow, investors expect the Federal Reserve to change its approach to raising interest rates, a move that could ease pressure on banks.\u201cMarkets are pricing for a pause in rate hikes in March,\u201d said Tina Teng, an analyst with CMC Markets in Auckland, New Zealand. Investors, she added, believe that U.S. authorities can contain the risk in the banking system.In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index was down 1.4 percent, while the South Korean benchmark erased losses and was up 0.5 percent. Indexes in greater China were outliers, with Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng rising more than 2 percent after China\u2019s central bank governor, Yi Gang, was reappointed to the job in a surprise move.Silicon Valley Bank is headquartered in Santa Clara, Calif., and had been a favored lender of the region\u2019s start-ups. Its troubles came to light after another bank\u2019s collapse: Silvergate, a California-based bank that made loans to cryptocurrency companies, announced Wednesday that it would cease operations and liquidate its assets.On Friday, regulators took control of Silicon Valley Bank, guaranteeing that deposits of up to $250,000 were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as is the norm. But there was concern that many of the bank\u2019s clients would be on the hook for losses because the bank had many accounts over that limit.\nThen on Sunday, the Fed, the Treasury and the F.D.I.C. issued a joint statement, saying that \u201cdepositors will have access to all of their money starting Monday, March 13.\u201d The regulators stressed that \u201cno losses associated with the resolution of Silicon Valley Bank will be borne by the taxpayer.\u201d Also on Sunday, regulators shut down Signature Bank in New York.The Fed is also setting up an emergency lending program, with approval from the Treasury, to funnel funding to eligible banks so they can \u201cmeet the needs of all their depositors.\u201dOne early beneficiary was San Francisco-based First Republic Bank, which on Sunday said that it received additional funding from the Fed and the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.",

	"text": "This summer, when Hong Kong\u2019s stock market rout seemed to have no end in sight, the city\u2019s financial chief, Paul Chan, jumped into action, creating a task force to inject confidence into a market that was being pummeled by global investors wary of China.Hong Kong cut taxes on trading, and Mr. Chan went on a roadshow to Europe and the United States, promising measures to \u201clet investors feel optimistic about the outlook.\u201d Investors were anything but sanguine, however, and the city\u2019s stock exchange is among the world\u2019s worst-performing stock markets this year.The Hang Seng Index finished Friday, its last trading day in 2023, 14 percent lower than it started the year. Stocks in mainland China also recorded losses this year, with the CSI 300, an index that tracks companies listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen, declining 11 percent.Hundreds of billions of dollars flowed out this year as money managers and pension funds reduced their holdings in Hong Kong, which has long been a gateway for foreign investors wanting to put money into mainland China. The outflows were largely driven by an economic downturn in China and mounting pressure on American investors to sell their exposure to Chinese companies.\n\u201cMany of the companies in the Hang Seng Index are essentially companies that are leveraged to economic growth in China,\u201d said Chetan Seth, an Asia equity strategist at Nomura, a Japanese bank. \u201cChina\u2019s weak economy clearly has weighed on the performance of Chinese stocks listed in Hong Kong,\u201d Mr. Seth said.\nThe losses in Hong Kong and the mainland contrasted sharply to what happened in the United States, where inflation eased and the job market was strong. The S&P 500, which broadly tracks U.S. stocks, was up 25 percent in 2023, underlining the divergent paths of the world\u2019s two largest economies.Global investors started the year optimistic that China\u2019s economy would bounce back after three years of strict pandemic rules and lockdowns. But when China fully opened its borders in January for the first time since 2020, many households were reluctant to spend. Private businesses floundered, and the economy slowed.\nChina\u2019s roiling property crisis has intensified the economic slump and spilled over into Hong Kong. After years of overexpansion and borrowing from foreign investors in Hong Kong, nearly every private Chinese real estate developer has collapsed.Chinese property companies listed in Hong Kong were among the worst-performing stocks. The real estate developer Country Garden, one of the biggest casualties of the property crisis, has lost nearly three-quarters of its value this year as it edges closer to a collapse.Mr. Chan, the finance secretary, has blamed \u201cmisunderstandings caused by Western political prejudices\u201d for the stock market\u2019s poor performance, as geopolitical tensions between Beijing and Washington hit a low point during the year. But 2023 was the fourth consecutive year that the Hang Seng recorded losses. Over that same time, Hong Kong\u2019s role as a financial nerve center for Asia diminished as it was forced to align more closely with Beijing under a far-reaching national security law.\nHong Kong\u2019s loss of autonomy to China has worried some global investors.A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 with a pledge that it would maintain a high degree of self-governance under a policy called \u201cone country, two systems.\u201d For two decades, this allowed Hong Kong to define itself as unique and distinct from the rest of China, while offering financial access to the world\u2019s second largest economy.\nBut after citywide protests in 2019, Beijing imposed the national security law, which has silenced political debate and stifled civic activity.More than 100,000 residents have left Hong Kong over the last few years, in part because of the security law and tough pandemic restrictions. Many young Hong Kong professionals who are still there have expressed a desire to leave, making it a challenge to recruit the talent that has helped the city function as a financial center.Once a major hub for Wall Street banks, Hong Kong had a drought of initial public offerings this year. Companies raised the lowest amount of money since 2001, resulting in layoffs at financial institutions citywide.Many international companies have stopped hiring for new positions in Hong Kong. With less money coming into the exchange and fewer transactions, dozens of brokerages have also closed.China\u2019s downturn, geopolitics, elections in major economies including the United States and the actions of central banks are all likely to make 2024 another volatile year for Hong Kong.Addressing some of these issues in an interview in a recent interview with the South China Morning Post, Mr. Chan said, \u201c2024 will be a year of high uncertainty.\u201d",

	"text": "Heat, drought, flood and famine. Evidence of climate change is all around us.If the planet is to avoid even more severe consequences from global warming, the world\u2019s leading energy agency says, consumption of oil, coal and natural gas needs to be reduced much more rapidly, and clean energy sources like wind and solar power need to expand at a far faster pace.But the stock market doesn\u2019t seem to have gotten the memo.Instead, the shares of a broad range of clean energy companies have been crushed lately, in a rout that encompasses just about every alternative energy sector, including solar, wind and geothermal power.At the same time, rather than weaning themselves off oil, Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the two biggest U.S. oil companies, are doubling down. They have announced acquisitions that will vastly increase their oil reserves. Exxon intends to buy Pioneer Natural Resources, a major shale drilling company, for $59.5 billion. Chevron plans a $53 billion purchase of Hess, a big integrated oil company. These are enormous bets on oil for years to come.It\u2019s a perplexing state of affairs. The evidence that carbon emissions are warming the planet is persuasive. Yet the stock market, which is supposed to be forward-looking, is treating alternative energy companies with disdain and big oil companies with respect.\nThere\u2019s something wrong here, obviously.I think the problem resides with the stock market, not the scientists.Benjamin Graham, the great value investor and Columbia professor, once said, \u201cIn the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.\u201dThat means that eventually the market gets things right, but in the short run, it\u2019s prone to enthusiasms, snap judgments and myopic thinking.That seems to be what\u2019s happening now.The Big Picture\nThe scientific consensus is clear. It sometimes seems there is a new and compelling study on climate change, with disturbing conclusions, every day.\nLast month, for example, in its latest comprehensive report on the world\u2019s chances of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2050, the International Energy Agency, the world\u2019s leading energy authority, said the climate was warming all too rapidly. The probability of a benign outcome is receding, it said, yet odds will improve if the world shifts aggressively from fossil to alternative fuels.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.In a separate study released this past week, a group of scientists said the planet probably had only a little over five years before global warming would exceed the most ambitious goal of the Paris climate agreement: warming of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, above temperatures that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution.Breach that limit and there will be catastrophes far worse than what we have experienced so far, the study said. Already, the planet has warmed 1.2 degrees Celsius. Governments, companies and consumers around the world need to take aggressive measures to curb carbon emissions immediately, the study said.If the stock market heeded such calls to action, you might expect that the alternative energy shares would be booming and that big oil companies would be pouring most of their money into renewable resources.But in its collective wisdom, the stock market seems to be embracing a different and contrary vision.\nStock LossesHundreds of billions of dollars are, in fact, being invested in renewable energy projects, even if the stock market generally isn\u2019t favoring them right now.The returns are ugly. The iShares Global Clean Energy E.T.F., an exchange-traded fund that tracks the entire industry, is down more than 30 percent this year. Even worse, since the start of 2021, it has lost more than 50 percent.Narrower sectors are being punished, too. The Invesco Solar E.T.F. is down more than 40 percent this year and almost 60 percent since Jan. 1, 2021. The First Trust Global Wind Energy E.T.F. has lost about 20 percent this year and about 40 percent since Jan. 1, 2021.Rising interest rates have increased costs and tempered consumer enthusiasm in many countries, reducing stock valuations for fast-growing companies that aren\u2019t churning out big profits. Renewable energy companies have been hard hit.\nSolarEdge, which provides equipment needed to convert energy from solar panels into power that can be transmitted through electric grids, warned on Oct. 17 that demand for its products was lagging. The market responded harshly.\nShares of the company, which is based in Israel, dropped nearly 30 percent in a single day. A host of other solar companies followed. Enphase Energy, a rival firm in Fremont, Calif., has lost almost 40 percent since Oct. 17.Wind energy companies haven\u2019t been spared, either. Shares of Orsted, the Danish wind turbine company, fell nearly 26 percent on Wednesday after it said it might have to write down as much as $5.6 billion on the value of its offshore wind projects in the United States.One Orsted venture, South Fork Wind, a set of turbines being installed 30 miles east of Montauk Point, is scheduled to start sending electricity to Long Island before the end of the year. But the company canceled two projects, known as Ocean Wind 1 and 2, that were to supply New Jersey with green energy, and some of its projects for New York and Connecticut have run into trouble, too.In October, New York State\u2019s Public Service Commission rejected requests from Orsted and several other companies \u2014 including BP and Equinor \u2014 for billions in electric rate increases to help defray their ballooning costs. The companies say that with inflation and higher interest rates increasing their costs, the viability of some of their projects in the New York metropolitan area is in doubt.\nBetting on Fossil FuelBig oil company profits and revenue have flagged since last year, when energy prices soared after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.For the entire S&P 500, earnings per share in the third quarter grew only 2.7 percent from a year earlier, John Butters, a senior earnings analyst for FactSet, estimated. Exclude the big energy companies, though, and that total increased to 8.4 percent. That\u2019s because earnings per share for big, fossil fuel energy companies declined 38.1 percent, more than for any other sector.Oil prices are volatile, and their trajectory in the years ahead is far from certain. But Exxon and Chevron are staking their futures on oil. Exxon\u2019s acquisition of Pioneer would be its biggest purchase since it bought Mobil in 1999. And Chevron will deepen its commitment to oil by acquiring Hess.Though I know better, I can\u2019t stop thinking of Hess as \u201cthe green company.\u201d That\u2019s only because I\u2019m an old New York Jets fan. Hess shares corporate history and a green-and-white motif with the Jets. Leon Hess founded the company, owned the team and liked the color green. But the Hess product line is petroleum-based. It\u2019s not a green company otherwise.\nBut no matter. Oil has been good to Hess\u2019s shareholders, and to shareholders of the three other companies. Over the last three years, Exxon has returned about 275 percent, including dividends; Chevron, 135 percent; Pioneer, 260 percent; and Hess, a whopping 310 percent. The S&P 500 returned about 32 percent.As long as the world consumes oil, companies like these will be profitable, or so oil bulls say.Plus, there is a wild card.As the World Bank warned on Monday, if the war between Israel and Hamas widens, conflict in the Middle East could easily set off a steep surge in oil prices. An escalation of the Russian-Ukrainian war could make oil soar as well. So could any number of potential military or political conflicts.If scientific findings dominate, oil could become a stranded asset, one that can\u2019t be sold. But the market consensus is that the viable life of Big Oil has a long way to go.Confounding ChoicesWhat are we to make of the messages the market is sending?For one thing, I wouldn\u2019t view them as inevitable. Prices shift every minute, and despite its vaunted reputation, the stock market doesn\u2019t provide a guide to the future. Sometimes it can\u2019t see what\u2019s right in front of it, and it certainly can\u2019t see around corners. I remain hopeful, despite discouraging tidings from the stock market.\nBut I wouldn\u2019t dismiss the stock market\u2019s signals entirely. Market prices incorporate the views of an awful lot of people who can\u2019t agree on much, except, at a particular moment, on the appropriate price for a specific offering. In that sense, the market is, as Benjamin Graham said, a voting machine.Pouring money into unprofitable ventures isn\u2019t a good strategy unless those ventures ultimately generate a great deal of cash. The jury is still out on many alternative energy companies, much as the world needs their products. Oil companies, on the other hand, are prized for their ability to gush cash.But if you\u2019re seeking a guide to the future, don\u2019t count on the stock market. I expect it to rise over the long run, and to make fickle and foolish choices along the way.",

	"text": "Wall Street\u2019s longest weekly winning streak in almost 20 years came to an end on Friday, as stock investors\u2019 celebrations over slowing inflation and the potential for cuts to interest rates were replaced with caution over the lingering risks to the economy.The S&P 500 index ended the week with a loss of 1.5 percent. It was the first weekly drop after nine straight weeks of gains \u2014 the market\u2019s longest winning streak since January 2004. The Nasdaq Composite, chock-full of tech stocks that soared in 2023, has also drifted lower.Analysts and investors said that for the time being the moves signaled only a mild pullback, rather than the start of a more severe downturn. Investors\u2019 unbridled optimism had pushed the S&P 500 almost 14 percent higher in the final two months of the year, to within a whisker of a new high.Alongside caution that stock market valuations had risen too far too quickly, investors\u2019 newfound sobriety was underpinned by a reassessment of when the Federal Reserve would begin to lower interest rates \u2014 cuts that could bolster stock prices, corporate profits and consumer spending. Heading into the end of 2023, investors were betting that rate cuts could start as soon as March.\n\u201cThe market has got a bit ahead of itself,\u201d Cayla Seder, a macro strategist at State Street, said, noting the risk that the slowdown in inflation could still reverse course. \u201cThere was so much optimism going into the end of the year.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Minutes of the Fed\u2019s last meeting in December, released on Wednesday, confirmed perceptions that the central bank\u2019s stance has shifted, with policymakers acknowledging a slowdown in inflation that probably means an end to further interest rate increases. But the minutes suggested policymakers are intent on keeping rates elevated until they are more confident that inflation is under control, putting pressure on the bets of a rate cut in the coming months. That, in turn, has weighed on stocks.On Friday, new data showed that the labor market remained strong in December, cementing confidence in the economy\u2019s resilience but also stoking concerns that inflation could yet reignite as wages continued to rise. The S&P 500 ended the day about 0.2 percent higher, though that was not enough to reverse the losses earlier in the week.The early slide marks the S&P 500\u2019s worst start to a year since 2015, though analysts cautioned about drawing strong conclusions from just four days of trading.Many of the stocks that propelled the market higher last year have been the anchor weighing it down in 2024. All of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, which include the biggest companies in the market that have an outsized impact on returns, rank among the worst performers for the week.\nCollectively, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent) and Meta (Facebook\u2019s parent) are responsible for nearly 70 percent of the S&P 500\u2019s drop since Jan. 2. Without them, the index would have fallen less than 1 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Apple, down about 6 percent since last Friday, has come under sustained pressure after two analysts downgraded their outlook for the company, pointing to falling iPhone sales that have contributed to contracting revenues.Some analysts say stock prices could fall further. While investors have dialed down bets on a rate cut coming in March, they are still expecting that a gradual slowdown in the economy will give the Fed license to cut borrowing costs by 0.75 percentage points by the end of July \u2014 as much as the central bank forecast in December for the whole of 2024.If the economy proves stronger than anticipated, the central bank is likely to hold rates higher for longer, disappointing investors. A sharp deterioration in the health of the economy could result in rate cuts, but for more worrying reasons.\u201cIt\u2019s all very Goldilocks,\u201d said George Goncalves, chief macro strategist at MUFG Securities. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\u201d\nA rise in longer-term borrowing costs, underpinned by the rate paid on government bonds, could also unsettle stock investors, after a stunning rally late last year dragged the yield on the 10-year Treasury down by roughly a percentage point to around 4 percent. Some bond traders surveyed by J.P. Morgan went into this week betting on a reversal of some of that move, and Friday\u2019s jobs data has already helped to push yields higher.\u201cOne of the big risks of leaning into a Fed relief rally is that after a couple of months, investors usually realize that the Fed is pulling back on interest rate hiking policy because they are seeing growth slow,\u201d which tends to be \u201cless constructive\u201d for the stock market, said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments.For many analysts, though, a modest pullback in the market was warranted after the searing rally at the end of 2023, with most stock market prognosticators still forecasting a rise in the S&P 500 over the next year.Roger Aliaga-Diaz, an economist at Vanguard, said the balance of risk had tilted toward a \u201crosy scenario\u201d while \u201cignoring all the risks that are, in our view, still there.\u201d\u201cWe are not out of the woods in terms of inflation,\u201d he warned.",

	"text": "It\u2019s dawning on stock investors that they were wrong about the Federal Reserve.After rallying behind a resilient economy, slowing inflation and the hope that the central bank would end its interest-rate increases sooner than it had communicated, stock trading has grown jittery.The S&P 500 has lost its momentum in February, after a drop this week that left it 2.4 percent lower than its peak early in the month. Stocks have oscillated between gains and losses as new economic data have clouded the outlook for investors, marking a notable shift in the market after stocks jumped more than 6 percent in January.The change in tone this week came as a steady flow of data has shown the economy continued to run hot in January. Despite high-profile layoffs at big technology firms like Meta and Microsoft, employers in the United States continued to hire at a rapid clip, consumers kept spending and prices continued to rise briskly at the start of the year across an array of goods and services.All those data points suggest that the economy retains significant vigor, even after a year of rapid policy adjustments aimed at cooling down the economy. Fed officials had repeatedly warned that there was more work to do to slow rising prices, but investors had hoped that a slowdown in inflation that took hold in earnest late last year would allow policymakers to hit pause on their rate adjustments sooner than they had predicted. Now, mounting evidence that the economy remains surprisingly strong and price increases unexpectedly stubborn have begun undercutting that narrative.\nIn response, investors have sharply raised their expectations for the number of times the Fed will increase interest rates in the coming months. And even central bankers themselves have begun to float the possibility that rates will need to climb higher than they previously expected if the economy does not cool down. Higher interest rates raise costs for consumers and companies, slowing demand and typically weighing on the stock market.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cI\u2019m very negative right now on equities,\u201d said Eric Johnston, the head of equity derivatives at Cantor Fitzgerald, who predicted the recent S&P 500 rally but now expects a slump. \u201cI think the move we have seen in the rate market, some of the inflation numbers that have come out and the expectation that the economy will be fine is all fairly problematic.\u201dMr. Johnston now thinks the S&P 500 will eventually fall below its 2022 low, a drop of more than 10 percent from current levels. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are also among those bracing for a fall.Bond investors had been quicker to shift their view.At the start of this month, investors betting on the path of interest rates predicted the Fed would raise its benchmark rate just once more this year, by a quarter of a percentage point in March.\nNow, those traders are leaning to three increases of that size, through July, which would take the Fed\u2019s target rate to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent. That\u2019s above the Fed\u2019s own most recent forecasts, published in December.\nBut policymakers have also hinted that their own estimates could be poised for revision if the economy continues to run hotter than previously anticipated. \n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.John C. Williams, president of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suggested this week that rates were likely to rise to a range of 5 percent to 5.5 percent \u2014 slightly above the 5 percent to 5.25 percent median in the central bank\u2019s December forecast. He and several of his colleagues have said they may need to do even more than that if consumption and the labor market remain so robust.\u201cWith the strength in the labor market, clearly there\u2019s risks that inflation stays higher for longer than expected or that we might need to raise rates higher than that,\u201d Mr. Williams told reporters in New York this week.Loretta Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said during a speech on Thursday that \u201cwe may very well have to move higher, hold it longer at that peak rate or even change what we do at any particular meeting\u201d if economic pressures kept inflation elevated.\nGiven recent data, economists at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America changed their forecasts on Thursday. They are now predicting that the Fed would raise rates to 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent this year \u2014 a quarter point higher than either bank had previously estimated.\u201cThe Fed might have to hike further if inflation, job growth and consumer demand refuse to soften,\u201d Michael Gapen at Bank of America wrote in a research note explaining the shift.For investors, the possibility of more rate moves has rekindled the fear that the Fed\u2019s campaign will push the economy into a downturn. It\u2019s an about-face from the more optimistic view that had taken hold in financial markets at the start of the year, that inflation could fall while the economy continued to grow.\u201cWe had just got comfortable with what the Fed told us it was going to do two weeks ago, and already we are having to rethink that,\u201d David Donabedian, the chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US, said, referring to the recent Fed meeting. \u201cThe momentum in the market has stopped.\u201d",

	"text": "Stocks and bonds rallied on Friday, extending a sharp reversal after fresh data about the health of the U.S. labor market capped a tumultuous week for investors.The 10-year government bond yield, which underpins rates on everything from mortgages to business loans, dropped 0.1 percentage points on Friday, another large decline for a market in which daily moves are measured in hundredths of a point. Yields move inversely to prices.A new report showed that the U.S. economy added fewer-than-expected jobs in October, a sign of a cooling labor market that could reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to raise its key rate again as it aims to slow the economy to fight inflation.That helped to lift the stock market, which had sold off as rates rose in recent months. The S&P 500 ended the week almost 6 percent higher, recording its best week of the year.\nThe Fed started raising its key short-term rate in March last year, but investors more recently had become fixated on longer-dated market rates, which are driven by a variety of factors like economic growth and inflation expectations, not just the Fed\u2019s policy decisions. These long-term rates began surging in August, intensifying concerns about the sustainability of the government\u2019s $33 trillion debt pile, among other worries.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Those concerns dissipated somewhat this week. Investors welcomed plans from the Treasury Department to skew its borrowing toward shorter-term debt, taking pressure off longer-dated yields. Then, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, appeared to soothe investors\u2019 nerves after the central bank held rates steady for a second consecutive meeting. Weaker-than-expected job growth further suggested that the Fed\u2019s efforts to slow the economy were having an effect.\u201cTo me, the jobs report is an unquestionable positive,\u201d said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really good signal to the Fed that they are slowing the economy and that they don\u2019t need to raise rates again.\u201d\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The 10-year Treasury yield fell 0.3 percentage points for the week to a little below 4.6 percent, its largest drop since the banking turmoil in March. Still, the yield remains more than half a percentage point higher than it was at the start of August.This week\u2019s dip in yields set off a broad rally across stock markets. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy, rose 2.8 percent on Friday. That index had fallen over 18 percent in recent months, but this week rallied back roughly 8 percent, its biggest one-week surge since the early pandemic recovery in 2020.\nStill, some investors warned that the market reaction might not reflect such a rosy story. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9 percent in October, from 3.8 percent the previous month, while the number of people working or actively looking for work nudged lower.\u201cWhat concerns me is when we see such an increase in the unemployment rate, it tends to trend higher,\u201d said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m monitoring closely. Otherwise, the slowdown in employment looks orderly.\u201dAfter the jobs report, investors dialed down the likelihood of the Fed raising interest rates at its next meeting, in December, and brought forward expectations of rate cuts next year, a sign that they believed the Fed was done increasing rates and that the economy would continue to slow.Mr. Powell, the Fed chair, said on Wednesday that the recent increase in long-term interest rates, which also raises borrowing costs and slows the economy, would need to be \u201cpersistent\u201d for it to play a role in convincing policymakers not to raise their key policy rate again.But if the recent reversal in the bond market persists and yields continue to fall, then \u201cironically\u201d it could make the Fed more likely to raise its rate in December, said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at the asset manager BlueBay, because it will lower borrowing costs and ease the brakes on the economy.\nAnd while a slowing economy would be expected to lower longer-term rates over time, worries over who will buy the deluge of debt the U.S. government is set to issue could push rates in the opposite direction.\u201cThere are two opposite forces at work,\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cOne is the slowing economy, which is entrenched now and that will bring yields down. But over time, the Treasury will issue more debt and those yields will go back up again. We are in a cross-current right now.\u201dJeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After several twists and turns this year, stock investors are in a celebratory mood. The S&P 500 set a new high for the year on Friday, a day after clocking its best month of 2023 in November, in a rally that quickly erased the benchmark index\u2019s steep drop over the summer.The reversal has come as investors have cheered signs that the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates, the primary tool in the central bank\u2019s effort to slow inflation. Those high rates have been a drag on corporate valuations because they raise costs for consumers and companies and give allure to investments outside the stock market.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, appeared to add to investors\u2019 bullish mood on Friday, suggesting that the economy continues to cool as expected.\u201cWe\u2019re getting what we wanted to get, we now have the ability to move carefully,\u201d Mr. Powell said at an event.\nWith a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the S&P 500 nudged past the previous high for the year, set at the end of July. The index has risen over 10 percent from its late October low. This week was the fifth straight weekly gain for the index, its longest winning streak since June.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Investors have also been encouraged that the rally has been broad based. It has been driven by the large technology companies that dominate the index but has also been backed up by a rise in over 80 percent of the stocks in the index in the past month.Overall, the S&P 500 has risen nearly 20 percent this year, surprising many analysts who had predicted at the start of 2023 that the index would extend its struggle from 2022, when it fell by around 20 percent. The rally in November has left the index just 4 percent below its highest-ever level, which many consider the bar that must be surpassed to confirm a new bull market.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.As inflation has continued to cool, pockets of weakness in the economy have given the Fed pause, as officials attempt to slow rising prices without tipping the country into a severe downturn. Fed officials held interest rates steady at their meeting last month to allow the rate increases so far to fully work through the economy.Investors have welcomed the central bank\u2019s caution after fears mounted over the summer that the resilience of the economy \u2014 which grew at a swift 5.2 percent pace in the three months through September \u2014 would prompt the Fed to raise rates even further, and keep them elevated for a long time.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, one of the most important interest rates in the world, has fallen almost 0.8 percentage points since its peak in October, to around 4.2 percent, a huge move in that market. That decline has pulled down borrowing costs that track the 10-year yield, like mortgage rates, and helped push stocks higher.The slide has undone some of the rise in Treasury yields that unnerved investors over the summer, dragging the S&P 500 from its July high.On Friday, the S&P 500\u2019s rally coincided with a sharp drop in two-year Treasury yields, which are sensitive to investors\u2019 changing interest expectations.But some analysts and investors have cautioned that the rise in the S&P 500 is not representative of the precarious position many companies across the country find themselves in. Even if the Fed refrains from raising rates further, they say, a long period of keeping rates at their current, elevated level could still cause pain for corporate America.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies in the United States, which lack the scale of the giants in the S&P 500 and tend to feel the effects of interest-rate shifts and economic wobbles more sharply, remains roughly 9 percent below its level at the end of July, and up just 4 percent for the year.",

	"text": "The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether the Trump administration had acted lawfully in banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts.In Supreme Court briefs, the Biden administration urged the justices to uphold the ban, endorsing a rare move by the Trump administration to curtail gun violence after a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.That October, a gunman armed with such a device opened fire at a music festival, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds of others.After the shootings, Justice Department officials initially said that the executive branch did not have the authority to ban bump stocks without congressional action. The department later changed course, determining it could ban the devices on its own.\nThe case concerns executive power, not the Second Amendment. Challengers have argued that the regulation, which went into effect in 2019, was not authorized by federal laws that largely ban machine guns.The National Firearms Act of 1934 defines a machine gun as \u201cany weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded the definition to include parts that can be used to convert a weapon into a machine gun.Lawyers for the government told the Supreme Court that bump stocks may be regulated under those laws.\u201cLike other machine guns, rifles modified with bump stocks are capable of firing hundreds of bullets per minute,\u201d said one brief in the case, Garland v. Cargill, No. 22-976.Quoting earlier findings, the brief said that \u201cthe Las Vegas mass shooter, for example, \u2018was able to fire several hundred rounds of ammunition in a short period of time\u2019 using bump stocks, \u2018killing 58 people and wounding approximately 500\u2019 in a matter of minutes.\u201d\nFederal appeals courts have issued conflicting rulings on whether the regulation was authorized by the laws. By one count, appeals courts have issued 22 opinions spanning some 350 pages.\u201cAnd yet,\u201d one of the challengers told the Supreme Court, \u201cthe purchase of 520,000 bump stocks, the expected loss of property in excess of $100 million, the lack of national uniformity in the sale and possession of bump stocks and the nonlegislative, unilateral criminalization of previously legal conduct all remain in controversy and dispute.\u201dBump stocks work by harnessing a firearm\u2019s recoil energy to allow it to keep firing after a single pull of the trigger. The Justice Department says this transforms semiautomatic weapons into machine guns subject to the federal laws.The challengers disagree. \u201cA weapon is not a machine gun if something more is required of the shooter than a single function of the trigger to produce more than one shot,\u201d a Supreme Court brief said. But, the brief added, \u201cthe shooter must do considerably more than pull the trigger once if he wishes the weapon to fire multiple shots.\u201dQuoting from the regulation, the challengers wrote that \u201cproducing a second shot requires the shooter to place \u2018forward pressure on the barrel-shroud or fore-grip of the rifle while simultaneously \u2018maintaining the trigger finger on the device\u2019s ledge with constant rearward pressure.\u2019\u201d",

	"text": "This is one of those stretches when you may want to avoid looking at your investments.Performance reports for the three months that ended in September are arriving now, and they are ugly. The vast majority of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds \u2014 the vehicles used by most Americans for their investments \u2014 fell. There were losses in most markets and in nearly all asset classes.If you\u2019ve lost money, take some deep breaths, practice yoga, watch a ballgame, enjoy time with family and friends \u2014 whatever works. But don\u2019t make abrupt changes in your investments. A good plan is better than an emotional response when markets fall.I say all that assuming you already have a solid investment portfolio set up \u2014 a simple one, ideally, containing cheap funds, preferably index funds that mirror the total market.If you don\u2019t have a solid plan yet, a downturn is a great time to start. Most basically, stock and bond prices will be lower than they were just a short time earlier.\nBut invest for the long term. Hold diversified stock funds for higher returns and bond funds for income and stability (though bonds haven\u2019t been paragons of stability lately), and stick with them. Stash the money you need to pay the bills in money-market funds, short-term savings accounts and Treasury bills.Keep your costs low and hold broadly diversified investments for years to come. For most people, that\u2019s a much better bet than stock-picking and frequent trading, numerous studies show.This approach requires the ability to withstand losses, though, and that ability is being tested now.Nasty NumbersThe average domestic stock fund in the Morningstar database declined 3.5 percent for the quarter. The average taxable bond fund fell 1.1 percent. The average municipal bond fund fell 3.3 percent. As a group, internationally oriented stock funds fared even worse. They declined 4.7 percent.Furthermore, core stock and bond indexes that function as benchmarks \u2014 and, in some cases, are the foundation \u2014 for many mutual funds and E.T.F.s. fell during the quarter.\nDividends included, the S&P 500 stock index lost 3.3 percent for the three months through September.These numbers aren\u2019t shocking in themselves. What makes them painful, however, is that they come after the markets had begun recovering from the steep declines of last year.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.It shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising when the stock market falls. Such declines have made headlines for decades. But bonds are different. They have a reputation for steady, even stodgy performance. The latest returns undercut those assumptions.For the last quarter, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index (it was once the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Index) lost 3.2 percent, including dividends, nearly as much as the S&P 500. What\u2019s worse, over three years, this core bond index lost nearly 15 percent, including interest paid out in dividends, while the S&P 500 gained about 34 percent.Those returns understate the bond market carnage. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Index, which tracks long-term Treasuries, lost 13 percent for the quarter \u2014 and about 42 percent for the three years through September, including dividends.You don\u2019t need to worry about individual, high-quality bonds if you hold them to maturity. But if you trade them while market interest rates rise, you can incur serious losses.\nWhat Causes the Losses?A major shift in interest rates caused the pain in the bond market and hurt stocks, too.Recall that during the first stage of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve dropped the short-term federal funds rate to nearly zero in a bid to support the ravaged economy. Then, after inflation became red hot, it began raising short-term rates early last year in an effort to put out the inflation fire. It isn\u2019t done yet.Longer-term rates in the bond market didn\u2019t rise as much or as quickly at first \u2014 perhaps signaling an eventual recession \u2014 but longer-term bond rates have been shooting up lately.Interest rate increases have caused automatic declines in bond prices. That\u2019s a function of bond math. Yields and prices move in opposite directions, so rising interest rates have translated into falling bond prices, especially for securities of longer duration.For stocks, the effects of rising rates are more complicated. For one thing, utilities and high dividend-paying stocks have been hit hard because their chief virtue \u2014 their ability to generate income \u2014 doesn\u2019t look nearly as attractive now that high-quality bonds offer reliable payouts of more than 5 percent annually. Beyond that, corporate costs have risen with higher interest rates, slightly impairing corporate earnings in the third quarter.Gains in the S&P 500 earlier in the year were based largely on investor optimism about future earnings growth. A.I. fever gripped the market, elevating stocks like Nvidia, which supplies computer chips that enable artificial intelligence programs to operate. Nvidia was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 for the calendar year through September, with a total return of nearly 198 percent.\nBut the market\u2019s mood has become dour as the Fed has signaled it intends to hold interest rates \u201chigher for longer.\u201dIn September, Nvidia shares flagged, however, with a decline for the month of 11.9 percent.The stock market is top-heavy, depending disproportionately on a handful of big companies. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 accounted for nearly 70 percent of the index\u2019s price increase for the calender year through September, according to Bespoke Investment Group. These are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Nvidia, Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly and Visa.When some of these stocks faltered in the third quarter, they pulled the market down with them. Apple declined 11.7 percent during the quarter. Because it is weighted so heavily in the S&P 500, it was responsible for one-fourth of the entire index\u2019s decline, Birinyi Associates calculated.Hurting and HelpingEnergy prices rose in the quarter, and that\u2019s caused a variety of problems. Gasoline has been getting expensive again, and higher energy costs are rippling through the economy, complicating the Fed\u2019s battle against inflation, while weighing on the profits of companies that are net energy consumers.But for some investors, there has been a bright side. Higher prices for energy are a boon for stocks and funds that focus on fossil fuel.\nCompare these stock returns for the quarter:Exxon Mobil, the oil giant, up 9.6 percent.Marathon Petroleum, the nation\u2019s largest petroleum refiner, up 29.8 percent.Solar Edge, which calls itself \u201ca visionary leader in smart energy technology, committed to harnessing the power of the sun to create a sustainable future,\u201d lost 51.9 percent, the worst quarterly performance in the S&P 500.Profiting from higher fossil fuel prices is less than ideal if you are worried about climate change. Yet the economy still depends on fossil fuels. And even if alternative energy comes to dominate the future, oil and gas are generating riches now.Energy stock funds focused mainly on fossil fuels rose 10.4 percent for the three months through September, according to Morningstar, and funds like Vanguard Energy Index Fund and Fidelity Advisor Energy Fund gained more than 13 percent. Exxon was the biggest holding in these funds.Energy \u2014 fossil fuel or alternative \u2014 has come in and out of favor, and prices have dropped in October. Where they head next is anybody\u2019s guess.OnwardMore broadly, where interest rates and inflation are going \u2014 and whether the economy will plunge into a recession \u2014 are crucial questions without reliable answers. I\u2019d be skeptical of anyone who claims to know.Predicting commodity, stock or bond prices is hazardous, at best. You can make big profits if you bet correctly, but you will be taking big risks.\nUnless you do this for a living, I wouldn\u2019t go there. Instead, for long-term investing, it\u2019s far more sensible for most people to seek absolutely average returns, without trying to pick favorites or time the movements of the markets.Just being average has been a solid strategy. Since November 2000, despite numerous crises and downturns, a basic investment with 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds in broad U.S. market index funds returned nearly 300 percent.To capture that return, you needed to have kept fees to a minimum, to have held diversified index funds and to have disregarded market dips like this one.There will be further storms ahead, and big ones. Try to prepare for them, and prosper.",

	"text": "After a year spent parsing Federal Reserve chair Jerome H. Powell\u2019s comments for clues about the direction of interest rates, some stock investors are going their own way.On Wednesday, despite Mr. Powell announcing a 0.25 percentage point increase in rates, pledging that there are more to come, and suggesting that rates won\u2019t be cut at all in 2023, the S&P 500 rose 1 percent. The gains added to a rally that\u2019s lifted shares by more than 7 percent this year.In the bond market, Treasury yields, indicative of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government and a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, fell.This is not how things have gone for most of the past year: Rising interest rates raise costs for consumers and companies, and the prospect of more increases has typically triggered stock market declines.\nBut lately, investors have latched on to signs that inflation is slowing, encouraging many to forecast that the end of the Fed\u2019s rate increases is near, even as the central bank has warned that their fight against inflation is far from over.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Trading on Wednesday illustrated the growing dissonance between investors and the Fed. Going by the market\u2019s move, it appears that investors are increasingly distrustful of the Fed\u2019s own forecasts.\u201cHe did say ongoing hikes but I still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. Mr. Brenner believes the rate increase made Wednesday will be the Fed\u2019s last. He said the market had lost faith in the Fed\u2019s forecasts after a year in which interest rates unexpectedly rose 4.5 percentage points. \u201cThis Fed has been more wrong than right and I think you can fight the Fed,\u201d he said.Mr. Brenner is not alone in his prediction. Though most investors are still forecasting another 0.25 percentage point rate increase in March, that outlook \u2014 reflected in trading in futures markets \u2014 is still below the Fed\u2019s own forecasts for two more quarter-point raises. Markets are also pricing in a cut in interest rates later this year, something Mr. Powell tried to rule out on Wednesday.\u201cI just don\u2019t see us cutting rates this year,\u201d he said.Investors weren\u2019t moved. The 10-year Treasury yield, which underpins borrowing costs around the world, fell 0.1 percentage points on Wednesday to 3.42 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, also fell 0.1 percent points to 4.12 percent.\nTechnology stocks, among the worst performing in 2022 because of their sensitivity to higher interest rates, have rallied this year. The Nasdaq Composite, stuffed full of technology stocks, jumped 2 percent on Wednesday. It has climbed nearly 13 percent this year, notching its best start to a year since 2001.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Still, the stock-market rally Wednesday is not going to be the final word on this matter.Rising stock prices and falling bond yields have created a problem for the Fed, enriching investors and making it easier for them to borrow, undercutting efforts to pull down still high inflation.\u201cThis loosening of financial conditions is undoubtedly not what the Fed was aiming for, and we expect a cacophony of Fed speeches in the coming weeks will aim to reorient the Fed\u2019s message,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, Ernst & Young\u2019s strategy consulting arm. \u201cIn other words, the infernal tango will continue as the Fed and markets try to find synchronized rhythms once again.\u201dThe last time stocks began to rise markedly, over the summer last year, Mr. Powell had to publicly warn that the fight against inflation was far from over. His caution then was enough to send stock prices sharply lower again.This time, Mr. Powell struck a more balanced tone, acknowledging the resilience of the economy and that he still expects it to grow this year. He said that investors appear to think inflation will fall more quickly than the Fed expects, allowing the central bank to reduce interest rates sooner.\n\u201cWe have a different view, a different forecast really,\u201d said Mr. Powell, noting that the central bank is willing to adjust its policy if it is wrong.The jump in stock prices this year has left some investors worried that markets are being too optimistic, with the Fed\u2019s impact on the economy, consumers and companies still to be fully realized. And if Mr. Powell is unsatisfied with the markets\u2019 response, he will get another chance to set things straight when he speaks at the Economic Club of New York next week.\u201cWe are shifting toward asking, how much damage has the Fed done?\u201d said Chris Murphy, a derivatives strategist at Susquehanna International Group. \u201cI think investors are underappreciating that.\u201d",

	"text": "This week, officials are expected to shut down all commercial and recreational salmon fishing off California for 2023. Much will be canceled off neighboring Oregon, too.The reason: An alarming decline of fish stocks linked to the one-two punch of heavily engineered waterways and the supercharged heat and drought that come with climate change. There are new threats in the ocean, too, that are less understood but may be tied to global warming, according to researchers.Scientists and fishers had been braced for bad numbers. Conditions were terrible a couple of years earlier, when the salmon were young and tiny in low, overheated creeks and rivers in California. But as the fish counts came in and the models spit out figures, the numbers were even more dismal than expected.Of all the salmon in California, fall-run Chinook were the last ones robust enough for commercial fishing. But this year, fewer than 170,000 are expected to return to Central Valley rivers. That\u2019s down from highs of over a million as recently as 1995.\nWhile some dips are normal, this one is not.\u201cCalifornia salmon are in dire straits,\u201d said Nate Mantua, a climate scientist who leads a team of salmon ecologists and biologists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Fisheries in Santa Cruz, Calif.The shutdown would mean higher prices and no fresh local salmon in California this year, though it probably would have little or no effect beyond the region.Salmon are hardy survivors that have lived on Earth far longer than humans. They migrate hundreds of miles from the freshwater creeks where they hatch to the salty ocean and back again, leaping up waterfalls on the return trip. But what\u2019s happening in California and Oregon, at the southern end of the range, scientists say, may be a harbinger of what\u2019s to come in cooler waters farther north.\u201cMost of the salmon populations around the entire Pacific Rim have been doing very, very poorly,\u201d Dr. Mantua said.\nPacific salmon will still be harvested off parts of Oregon, Washington and Alaska. It\u2019s a complicated picture. Some varieties, like sockeye in Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay, are booming. But some Chinook stocks farther north have collapsed. Overall, scientists say, the picture is grim.The assault on California salmon started two centuries ago. First fur traders wiped out beavers, whose dams created exceptional salmon habitat. Then came the Gold Rush, with hydraulic mining that choked creeks with gravel. Settlers drained and channelized the vast California delta and beyond. Next came dams, those engineering marvels that supplied water for a growing population and turned California into an agricultural powerhouse. In the process of all that, California lost about 90 percent of its wetlands.Latest News on Climate Change\u00a0and the EnvironmentCard 1 of 5Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The island\u2019s expansive ice sheet is known to be shrinking, especially since the 1990s, because of warming from climate change. Now, a new study reveals that about 20% more of the Greenland ice sheet has disappeared\u00a0than previous estimates show, potentially threatening ocean currents that help to regulate global temperatures.Droughts around the world. The U.N. estimates that 1.84 billion people worldwide, or nearly a quarter of humanity, were living under drought in 2022 and 2023, the vast majority in low- and middle-income countries. The crisis, worsened partly by climate change, has been accompanied by soaring food prices and could have consequences for hunger, elections and migration.U.S. carbon emissions fall. America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions fell 1.9% in 2023, in large part because the burning of coal to produce electricity plummeted to its lowest level in half a century, according to new research. Still, the decline in emissions to date hasn\u2019t been nearly steep enough to meet that nation\u2019s goals for trying to slow global warming.High-cost disasters. The United States experienced 28 disasters in 2023 that each cost at least $1 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the highest number on record and the latest measure of the growing financial toll of climate change. The previous record was 2020, which saw 22 billion-dollar events.A year of record heat. It\u2019s official: 2023 was Earth\u2019s hottest year by far in a century and a half. To climate scientists, it comes as no surprise that unabated emissions of greenhouse gases\u00a0caused global warming to reach new highs. The big question is whether 2023 foretells more years in which heat records are not merely broken, but smashed.The reshaping of water flows cut off salmon from the mountain rivers where they cooled off in summer and from the floodplains, rich with bugs, where they packed on weight in winter. The loss of these and other habitats means the fish are less able to cope with the latest attack: climate change, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels.\nWhile recent rain and snow in California may help salmon rebound in three years, when the fish from this year\u2019s eggs are ready to be harvested in the ocean, the intensity of the flooding comes with downsides. Raging torrents can scour the riverbeds where salmon lay their eggs.People who rely on the fish are facing a painful reality.Keith Parker, senior fisheries biologist for the Yurok Tribe, whose members fish along the Klamath River in California, called the situation tragic. \u201cWe lost our language,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cWe lost our religion for a long time. We lost our fish. So, we lost a lot.\u201d When the fish are plentiful, Mr. Parker said, you can see a difference in people. \u201cOur community is much happier, it\u2019s healthier,\u201d he said. \u201cMental health is better.\u201dThe commercial salmon industry plans to request federal disaster relief. They don\u2019t just blame the drought; they blame the way water is allocated for agriculture.\u201cThere\u2019s been an ongoing war for years over water for salmon,\u201d said Glen Spain, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Associations. \u201cOur industry requires that water be left in the river. Big Ag has been trying to get the water out of the river into the fields.\u201dIt\u2019s an increasingly contentious issue in California politics.Many varieties of salmon are already listed as threatened or endangered in California, but a formidable hatchery effort in the Central Valley has kept fall-run Chinook, which return to California rivers in the autumn, strong enough for commercial and recreational fishing. But not this year.\nAlso known as king salmon, Chinook, with a high fat content and buttery taste, is generally the most valuable of Pacific salmon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad on two levels,\u201d said Sarah Bates, who fishes for salmon out of San Francisco. \u201cThe loss of income and loss of work is upsetting, but the deeper understanding of what\u2019s happening to our ecosystems and food resources is pretty devastating.\u201dCentral Valley hatcheries raise about 30 million fall-run Chinook a year, which can be largely protected from poor conditions in the rivers. In bad years, young salmon are loaded into trucks and driven to the sea. But even those fish are disappearing.Scientists worry that hatchery efforts are backfiring in part by weakening salmon\u2019s genetic resilience. Once in the ocean, the fish face another slew of threats that are less understood.\nOcean forces were found to be a major factor in the only other total shutdowns of salmon fishing in California, which happened in 2008 and 2009. The ocean off California has, at times, already gotten as hot as climate change models predicted it would be at the end of the century, said Steve Lindley, fisheries ecology division director for NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. What saves salmon is an upwelling of nutrient-rich, cold water along the coast. But that upwelling was delayed in the mid-2000s, leaving the salmon with little food. They either starved or remained so small that they were picked off by seabirds, researchers found.Threats at sea are most likely playing a much smaller, but still notable, role in this year\u2019s dismal numbers, scientists say. One possible factor: Booming anchovy populations. In recent years, salmon have made anchovies a higher percentage of their diet. But anchovies contain an enzyme that breaks down thiamine, or vitamin B1, and salmon are becoming thiamine deficient. (Scientists connected the dots when baby fish started swimming upside down and dying. Infusing hatchery water with thiamine set them right.)What\u2019s becoming increasingly clear, according to scientists at NOAA Fisheries, is that the models used to predict stocks and manage fishing aren\u2019t working like they used to.\u201cWe keep getting surprised, even though we\u2019re trying to adjust expectations downward every year because of the previous surprises,\u201d Dr. Lindley said. That makes it harder to set fishing seasons and ensure fishers don\u2019t catch more than expected.To make matters worse, he said, an El Ni\u00f1o pattern is on the horizon, which could make the cold stream of water along the coast disappear. \u201cThis is what really scares some of us,\u201d Dr. Lindley said.\nGlobally, the ocean has absorbed more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped on the planet by greenhouse gases.\nWhat gives Dr. Lindley and other scientists hope are efforts to fix the underlying causes of salmon declines rather than the symptoms.\nFossil fuel emissions must be addressed, scientists say. Meanwhile, restoring habitat lets salmon do what they\u2019ve evolved to do: Offset risk by spreading it out over space and time. Even within a salmon species, different populations return to different parts of different rivers at different times of the year. Think of it like diversifying risk across an investment portfolio, said Daniel Schindler, a professor at the University of Washington who studies watersheds and fish.\u201cThe best thing we can do is give those fish the best chance they have to figure it out evolutionarily,\u201d Dr. Schindler said, which means giving them as many habitat options as possible.So there was joy on the Klamath River last month as crews broke ground on a megaproject to remove four old hydroelectric dams, which will give salmon access to more than 400 miles of historic habitat, including so-called thermal refuges like cold springs.\u201cEven though it\u2019s like the lowest salmon runs and it\u2019s horrible, on the other side of the coin, it\u2019s also one of the greatest years because in July the first dam is coming down,\u201d said Mr. Parker of the Yurok tribe, which has been pushing for the project along with other tribes, the fishing industry and conservation groups.Another bright spot is efforts in which salmon advocates are working with farmers to find win-win solutions, such as turning rice fields into temporary floodplains in the winter, when rain is more plentiful, and growing salmon on them. Research has shown the young fish can grow 10 times as big that way, feasting on a bug buffet that simply doesn\u2019t exist in the faster-flowing rivers, which leaves them better equipped to survive their next stage of life in the ocean.\nAt the same time, the effort recharges groundwater and fertilizes the rice fields.Much of the water conflict in California, which is often framed as farmers versus fish, is actually the result of systems built long ago, when we knew far less about how rivers work, said Jacob Katz, a senior scientist with California Trout, a nonprofit group focused on restoring California\u2019s waterways.\u201cYou get this idea that it\u2019s an inevitable trade-off between agricultural production and wildlife production,\u201d Dr. Katz said. \u201cAnd what we see is that\u2019s not the case, that there is an incredible amount of middle ground.\u201d",

	"text": "Stocks nudged higher in choppy trading on Monday, as investors cautiously welcomed moves to shore up the global financial system after the collapse of four banks set off turmoil in financial markets this month.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent, with every sector of the index ending up for the day. Monday\u2019s bounce came a day after Swiss authorities arranged a hasty takeover of the nation\u2019s embattled lender, Credit Suisse, by its rival, UBS. Major central banks also moved on Sunday to make dollar funding more readily available, and federal regulators announced an acquisition of parts of the collapsed Signature Bank in New York.Those efforts brought some relief to worried investors, even as they remained mindful that more turmoil could yet emerge. Already, analysts are concerned about the potential knock-on impact to the economy that could come as banks pull back from lending in order to insulate themselves from any further fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.The cautious tone on Monday also came a day before the Federal Reserve begins a crucial meeting. The Fed has been raising interest rates to rein in stubbornly higher inflation, but the volatility\u00a0in the banking sector has led to a complete reassessment of what the central bank will do next as investors worry about policymakers further turning the screws on an economy already showing signs of stress.\nTraders are evenly split on whether the central bank will raise interest rates at all when it announces a decision on Wednesday, a sharp change from just a few weeks ago, when many in markets expected the Fed to increase the rate\u00a0by half a percentage point\u00a0in response to hotter than expected inflation data.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Economists at Goldman Sachs said on Monday that they now expected the Fed to hold off raising rates this week \u201cbecause of stress in the banking system.\u201dThat stress was still evident in shares of some small banks. Notably, First Republic Bank, the target of a rescue attempt by larger rivals that injected billions in deposits into the lender\u00a0last week, slid nearly 50 percent on Monday. Its stock has dropped 90 percent this month, erasing tens of billions of dollars of market value and putting its future as an independent bank in doubt. First Republic\u2019s credit rating was downgraded by S&P Global on Sunday, for the second time in less than a week.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Another relatively small lender, Western Alliance, also tumbled. Its shares fell 6.7 percent after initially starting the day with a gain.In Zurich, Credit Suisse\u2019s share price slumped over 50 percent after its deal with UBS, which was agreed at a hefty discount to Credit Suisse\u2019s market value on Friday. Shares of\u00a0UBS gained more than 3 percent.\nSome American banks that have wavered after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank fared better on Monday. Shares of PacWest rose, as did Comerica and Zions Bank.Yet even as the volatile trading conditions in financial markets appeared to be easing, the fallout from the recent rout was still being felt by some investors.One strategy that has been particular hard hit by the recent turbulence is that of Commodity Trading Advisors. The strategy is employed by some of the largest investment funds in the world and follows the momentum of markets, buying as prices rise and selling as they fall. This makes these funds susceptible to sharp changes that can catch them off guard. An index of the 20 largest CTA managers run by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has fallen nearly 9 percent since the sell-off began.In debt markets, the Credit Suisse deal caused unease that some investors worried could linger because it upended the normal hierarchy in which investors\u00a0were paid back when a company faltered. Investors who own stock in a company are typically last in line to be paid when a company is wiped out. But in this case, owners of stock in Credit Suisse received one UBS share for every 22.48 shares they owned, according to the terms of the deal.In contrast, a special form of risky bank debt, known as AT1 bonds, were wiped out. On Monday, banking regulators and supervisors in the European Union, of which Switzerland is not a member, issued a statement reiterating that in their jurisdiction shareholders bear losses at banks before bondholders. The price of other European AT1 bank debt slid on Monday.\u201cI think it was a mistake to mess with the AT1s,\u201d\u00a0Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, said. \u201cThey have made everyone question this market.\u201dJason Karaian and Kevin Granville contributed reporting.",

	"text": "The new movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d dramatizes the true story of an unlikely messiah named Roaring Kitty who decides to sink his life savings into shares of the video-game seller GameStop and then praise the stock to his fans. So many people buy GameStop shares that the company\u2019s valuation soars, crushing the positions of professional hedge funds that had bet against it. Thus, a band of lovable misfits triumphs over the Wall Street fat cats.Much as we enjoyed the movie, we are economists, not movie critics. And as practitioners of the dismal science, we worry that some viewers will continue to be inspired to copy the heroes\u2019 investment strategies, which is about as smart as driving home at 100 miles per hour after seeing \u201cThe Fast and the Furious.\u201dYou can see our worry in the movie\u2019s title: \u201cDumb Money.\u201d That\u2019s Wall Street parlance for unsophisticated individual investors who make mistakes that can be exploited. Is it nice to call the actions of everyday Joe investors dumb? No. Is it fair? Well \u2026 yes.We aren\u2019t literally calling retail investors dumb. What we are saying is that retail investors are smart people who unfortunately behave in dumb, self-destructive ways. Their actions reflect overconfidence, financial ignorance and a wealth-reducing love of gambling. Even smart people like Sir Isaac Newton can make dumb investment decisions (he lost money in the South Sea bubble).\nAnd in celebrating an unintelligent investment strategy in a moment when the stock market was reaching historic heights of stupidity, \u201cDumb Money\u201d raises an important question: Are American financial markets getting dumber over time? Or was this just a momentary lapse?We did see a prior peak of stock market dumbness in the 1999-2000 tech stock bubble, when many retail investors made the mistake of being wildly overoptimistic about technology stocks. One of us, Owen Lamont, has even co-written (with Andrea Frazzini) an academic paper titled, you guessed it, \u201cDumb Money,\u201d describing self-destructive investor behavior during this period. But compared to the events of the GameStop story, that crazy optimism seems almost rational, since it at least involved a correct thesis (that the internet would eventually produce some profitable companies), however stupidly applied.After the tech bubble burst a year or so later, U.S. stock markets were less obviously dumb until the Covid-19 lockdowns spurred a tsunami of retail investing, as enormous numbers of people were suddenly stuck at home with nothing to do and, importantly, nothing to bet on. Casinos were closed and professional sports were on hold. Meanwhile, brokers like Robinhood were offering the option of trading stocks commission-free.The gambling impulse was also goosed by stimulus checks and social media platforms like Reddit and YouTube. Money flowed to \u201cmeme stocks,\u201d shares of oftentimes struggling companies that somehow caught the popular imagination owing to nostalgia or the desire to root for the underdog. This brings us to GameStop, a meme stock whose rise at the start of 2021 \u2014 despite the company\u2019s dismal business outlook \u2014 was really also an expression of populist anger. Ordinary Americans wanted to bet on the home team (an army of individual investors) against that other team (sinister billionaires betting against America).Since GameStop, a suspiciously high number of other dumb things have occurred recently. Just this year, we\u2019ve seen bizarre price fluctuations of meme stocks that are in or approaching bankruptcy and in foreign companies listing in the United States. One possible culprit for this wave of global dumbening is social media, which played a big role in GameStop by facilitating investor herding.\nShould we throw up our hands and conclude that the whole stock market is crazy? No. These crazy incidents still remain confined to only a few stocks. Stock prices usually revert to fundamental value, although it may take years. When this happens, retail investors who overpaid and held on too long get hurt.Retail investors have a well-established track record of destroying their own wealth. Studies have shown that individual traders somehow have the opposite of skill \u2014 they manage to do worse than they would by picking stocks at random.Why? Investing is hard, and there is a lot of competition. There are thousands of actively managed mutual funds. Do you think the average golfer would have a chance against Tiger Woods in his prime?The ineptitude of individual investors is not for lack of trying. In fact, the harder that individual investors try (in the sense of trading more often), the more they lose. For example, the professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean found that women investors did better than men. Why? Because men traded more. (They titled their paper \u201cBoys Will Be Boys.\u201d) So the conclusion from this finding is not (necessarily) that men are dumber. They are just more aggressively and overconfidently manifesting their dumbness. Perhaps this idea will resonate with some readers.The wealth-destroying powers of retail investors have been demonstrated many times: in stocks, mutual funds and options markets; in different countries and in different time periods. The evidence from Taiwan, which has excellent data on stock market trading, is particularly striking. Mr. Barber and Mr. Odean, together with their co-authors Yi-Tsung Lee and Yu-Jane Liu, have shown that individual investors underperform other investors by nearly 4 percent per year and that these losses are equivalent to about 2 percent of Taiwan\u2019s G.D.P.\nIf retail investors are the dumb money, who\u2019s the smart money? The answer includes skeptics who can spot a company\u2019s shortcomings and express their views by either selling their shares or betting that share prices will fall in a practice called short selling.Although \u201cDumb Money\u201d depicts professional hedge fund investors as heartless villains who treat a pet pig better than their housekeepers, it would be wrong for movie audiences to think that selling short is inherently bad. As we saw in the movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which depicts a band of misfit short sellers spotting major problems in the U.S. financial system before its near collapse in 2008, these investors can also be lovable \u2014 even heroes. (Full disclosure: We may be biased about \u201cThe Big Short\u201d because one of us had a small part in the movie, while the other is jealous about that fact.)We certainly hope that over time, widespread meme stock investing will go the way of toilet paper hoarding and people will go back to rooting for the Red Sox versus the Yankees (or vice versa) instead of Roaring Kitty versus hedge funds. We hope that citizens concerned about inequality will express themselves in the voting booth, not in the stock market. And we hope that retail investors confine their gambling to small stakes, like buying lottery tickets or placing wagers on their favorite teams.Ask any finance professor and you\u2019ll get the same boring answer: The best way for most people to invest in the long term is to hold a diversified portfolio of stocks. Admittedly, a movie about a bunch of ordinary people gradually building wealth through prudent financial decisions would be the world\u2019s most boring movie. Boring, but also not dumb.\nOwen A.

	"text": "It\u2019s dawning on stock investors that they were wrong about the Federal Reserve.After rallying behind a resilient economy, slowing inflation and the hope that the central bank would end its interest-rate increases sooner than it had communicated, stock trading has grown jittery.The S&P 500 has lost its momentum in February, after a drop this week that left it 2.4 percent lower than its peak early in the month. Stocks have oscillated between gains and losses as new economic data have clouded the outlook for investors, marking a notable shift in the market after stocks jumped more than 6 percent in January.The change in tone this week came as a steady flow of data has shown the economy continued to run hot in January. Despite high-profile layoffs at big technology firms like Meta and Microsoft, employers in the United States continued to hire at a rapid clip, consumers kept spending and prices continued to rise briskly at the start of the year across an array of goods and services.All those data points suggest that the economy retains significant vigor, even after a year of rapid policy adjustments aimed at cooling down the economy. Fed officials had repeatedly warned that there was more work to do to slow rising prices, but investors had hoped that a slowdown in inflation that took hold in earnest late last year would allow policymakers to hit pause on their rate adjustments sooner than they had predicted. Now, mounting evidence that the economy remains surprisingly strong and price increases unexpectedly stubborn have begun undercutting that narrative.\nIn response, investors have sharply raised their expectations for the number of times the Fed will increase interest rates in the coming months. And even central bankers themselves have begun to float the possibility that rates will need to climb higher than they previously expected if the economy does not cool down. Higher interest rates raise costs for consumers and companies, slowing demand and typically weighing on the stock market.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cI\u2019m very negative right now on equities,\u201d said Eric Johnston, the head of equity derivatives at Cantor Fitzgerald, who predicted the recent S&P 500 rally but now expects a slump. \u201cI think the move we have seen in the rate market, some of the inflation numbers that have come out and the expectation that the economy will be fine is all fairly problematic.\u201dMr. Johnston now thinks the S&P 500 will eventually fall below its 2022 low, a drop of more than 10 percent from current levels. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are also among those bracing for a fall.Bond investors had been quicker to shift their view.At the start of this month, investors betting on the path of interest rates predicted the Fed would raise its benchmark rate just once more this year, by a quarter of a percentage point in March.\nNow, those traders are leaning to three increases of that size, through July, which would take the Fed\u2019s target rate to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent. That\u2019s above the Fed\u2019s own most recent forecasts, published in December.\nBut policymakers have also hinted that their own estimates could be poised for revision if the economy continues to run hotter than previously anticipated. \n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.John C. Williams, president of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suggested this week that rates were likely to rise to a range of 5 percent to 5.5 percent \u2014 slightly above the 5 percent to 5.25 percent median in the central bank\u2019s December forecast. He and several of his colleagues have said they may need to do even more than that if consumption and the labor market remain so robust.\u201cWith the strength in the labor market, clearly there\u2019s risks that inflation stays higher for longer than expected or that we might need to raise rates higher than that,\u201d Mr. Williams told reporters in New York this week.Loretta Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said during a speech on Thursday that \u201cwe may very well have to move higher, hold it longer at that peak rate or even change what we do at any particular meeting\u201d if economic pressures kept inflation elevated.\nGiven recent data, economists at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America changed their forecasts on Thursday. They are now predicting that the Fed would raise rates to 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent this year \u2014 a quarter point higher than either bank had previously estimated.\u201cThe Fed might have to hike further if inflation, job growth and consumer demand refuse to soften,\u201d Michael Gapen at Bank of America wrote in a research note explaining the shift.For investors, the possibility of more rate moves has rekindled the fear that the Fed\u2019s campaign will push the economy into a downturn. It\u2019s an about-face from the more optimistic view that had taken hold in financial markets at the start of the year, that inflation could fall while the economy continued to grow.\u201cWe had just got comfortable with what the Fed told us it was going to do two weeks ago, and already we are having to rethink that,\u201d David Donabedian, the chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US, said, referring to the recent Fed meeting. \u201cThe momentum in the market has stopped.\u201d",

	"text": "Stocks and bonds rallied on Friday, extending a sharp reversal after fresh data about the health of the U.S. labor market capped a tumultuous week for investors.The 10-year government bond yield, which underpins rates on everything from mortgages to business loans, dropped 0.1 percentage points on Friday, another large decline for a market in which daily moves are measured in hundredths of a point. Yields move inversely to prices.A new report showed that the U.S. economy added fewer-than-expected jobs in October, a sign of a cooling labor market that could reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to raise its key rate again as it aims to slow the economy to fight inflation.That helped to lift the stock market, which had sold off as rates rose in recent months. The S&P 500 ended the week almost 6 percent higher, recording its best week of the year.\nThe Fed started raising its key short-term rate in March last year, but investors more recently had become fixated on longer-dated market rates, which are driven by a variety of factors like economic growth and inflation expectations, not just the Fed\u2019s policy decisions. These long-term rates began surging in August, intensifying concerns about the sustainability of the government\u2019s $33 trillion debt pile, among other worries.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Those concerns dissipated somewhat this week. Investors welcomed plans from the Treasury Department to skew its borrowing toward shorter-term debt, taking pressure off longer-dated yields. Then, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, appeared to soothe investors\u2019 nerves after the central bank held rates steady for a second consecutive meeting. Weaker-than-expected job growth further suggested that the Fed\u2019s efforts to slow the economy were having an effect.\u201cTo me, the jobs report is an unquestionable positive,\u201d said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really good signal to the Fed that they are slowing the economy and that they don\u2019t need to raise rates again.\u201d\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The 10-year Treasury yield fell 0.3 percentage points for the week to a little below 4.6 percent, its largest drop since the banking turmoil in March. Still, the yield remains more than half a percentage point higher than it was at the start of August.This week\u2019s dip in yields set off a broad rally across stock markets. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy, rose 2.8 percent on Friday. That index had fallen over 18 percent in recent months, but this week rallied back roughly 8 percent, its biggest one-week surge since the early pandemic recovery in 2020.\nStill, some investors warned that the market reaction might not reflect such a rosy story. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9 percent in October, from 3.8 percent the previous month, while the number of people working or actively looking for work nudged lower.\u201cWhat concerns me is when we see such an increase in the unemployment rate, it tends to trend higher,\u201d said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m monitoring closely. Otherwise, the slowdown in employment looks orderly.\u201dAfter the jobs report, investors dialed down the likelihood of the Fed raising interest rates at its next meeting, in December, and brought forward expectations of rate cuts next year, a sign that they believed the Fed was done increasing rates and that the economy would continue to slow.Mr. Powell, the Fed chair, said on Wednesday that the recent increase in long-term interest rates, which also raises borrowing costs and slows the economy, would need to be \u201cpersistent\u201d for it to play a role in convincing policymakers not to raise their key policy rate again.But if the recent reversal in the bond market persists and yields continue to fall, then \u201cironically\u201d it could make the Fed more likely to raise its rate in December, said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at the asset manager BlueBay, because it will lower borrowing costs and ease the brakes on the economy.\nAnd while a slowing economy would be expected to lower longer-term rates over time, worries over who will buy the deluge of debt the U.S. government is set to issue could push rates in the opposite direction.\u201cThere are two opposite forces at work,\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cOne is the slowing economy, which is entrenched now and that will bring yields down. But over time, the Treasury will issue more debt and those yields will go back up again. We are in a cross-current right now.\u201dJeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After several twists and turns this year, stock investors are in a celebratory mood. The S&P 500 set a new high for the year on Friday, a day after clocking its best month of 2023 in November, in a rally that quickly erased the benchmark index\u2019s steep drop over the summer.The reversal has come as investors have cheered signs that the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates, the primary tool in the central bank\u2019s effort to slow inflation. Those high rates have been a drag on corporate valuations because they raise costs for consumers and companies and give allure to investments outside the stock market.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, appeared to add to investors\u2019 bullish mood on Friday, suggesting that the economy continues to cool as expected.\u201cWe\u2019re getting what we wanted to get, we now have the ability to move carefully,\u201d Mr. Powell said at an event.\nWith a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the S&P 500 nudged past the previous high for the year, set at the end of July. The index has risen over 10 percent from its late October low. This week was the fifth straight weekly gain for the index, its longest winning streak since June.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Investors have also been encouraged that the rally has been broad based. It has been driven by the large technology companies that dominate the index but has also been backed up by a rise in over 80 percent of the stocks in the index in the past month.Overall, the S&P 500 has risen nearly 20 percent this year, surprising many analysts who had predicted at the start of 2023 that the index would extend its struggle from 2022, when it fell by around 20 percent. The rally in November has left the index just 4 percent below its highest-ever level, which many consider the bar that must be surpassed to confirm a new bull market.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.As inflation has continued to cool, pockets of weakness in the economy have given the Fed pause, as officials attempt to slow rising prices without tipping the country into a severe downturn. Fed officials held interest rates steady at their meeting last month to allow the rate increases so far to fully work through the economy.Investors have welcomed the central bank\u2019s caution after fears mounted over the summer that the resilience of the economy \u2014 which grew at a swift 5.2 percent pace in the three months through September \u2014 would prompt the Fed to raise rates even further, and keep them elevated for a long time.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, one of the most important interest rates in the world, has fallen almost 0.8 percentage points since its peak in October, to around 4.2 percent, a huge move in that market. That decline has pulled down borrowing costs that track the 10-year yield, like mortgage rates, and helped push stocks higher.The slide has undone some of the rise in Treasury yields that unnerved investors over the summer, dragging the S&P 500 from its July high.On Friday, the S&P 500\u2019s rally coincided with a sharp drop in two-year Treasury yields, which are sensitive to investors\u2019 changing interest expectations.But some analysts and investors have cautioned that the rise in the S&P 500 is not representative of the precarious position many companies across the country find themselves in. Even if the Fed refrains from raising rates further, they say, a long period of keeping rates at their current, elevated level could still cause pain for corporate America.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies in the United States, which lack the scale of the giants in the S&P 500 and tend to feel the effects of interest-rate shifts and economic wobbles more sharply, remains roughly 9 percent below its level at the end of July, and up just 4 percent for the year.",

	"text": "The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether the Trump administration had acted lawfully in banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts.In Supreme Court briefs, the Biden administration urged the justices to uphold the ban, endorsing a rare move by the Trump administration to curtail gun violence after a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.That October, a gunman armed with such a device opened fire at a music festival, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds of others.After the shootings, Justice Department officials initially said that the executive branch did not have the authority to ban bump stocks without congressional action. The department later changed course, determining it could ban the devices on its own.\nThe case concerns executive power, not the Second Amendment. Challengers have argued that the regulation, which went into effect in 2019, was not authorized by federal laws that largely ban machine guns.The National Firearms Act of 1934 defines a machine gun as \u201cany weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded the definition to include parts that can be used to convert a weapon into a machine gun.Lawyers for the government told the Supreme Court that bump stocks may be regulated under those laws.\u201cLike other machine guns, rifles modified with bump stocks are capable of firing hundreds of bullets per minute,\u201d said one brief in the case, Garland v. Cargill, No. 22-976.Quoting earlier findings, the brief said that \u201cthe Las Vegas mass shooter, for example, \u2018was able to fire several hundred rounds of ammunition in a short period of time\u2019 using bump stocks, \u2018killing 58 people and wounding approximately 500\u2019 in a matter of minutes.\u201d\nFederal appeals courts have issued conflicting rulings on whether the regulation was authorized by the laws. By one count, appeals courts have issued 22 opinions spanning some 350 pages.\u201cAnd yet,\u201d one of the challengers told the Supreme Court, \u201cthe purchase of 520,000 bump stocks, the expected loss of property in excess of $100 million, the lack of national uniformity in the sale and possession of bump stocks and the nonlegislative, unilateral criminalization of previously legal conduct all remain in controversy and dispute.\u201dBump stocks work by harnessing a firearm\u2019s recoil energy to allow it to keep firing after a single pull of the trigger. The Justice Department says this transforms semiautomatic weapons into machine guns subject to the federal laws.The challengers disagree. \u201cA weapon is not a machine gun if something more is required of the shooter than a single function of the trigger to produce more than one shot,\u201d a Supreme Court brief said. But, the brief added, \u201cthe shooter must do considerably more than pull the trigger once if he wishes the weapon to fire multiple shots.\u201dQuoting from the regulation, the challengers wrote that \u201cproducing a second shot requires the shooter to place \u2018forward pressure on the barrel-shroud or fore-grip of the rifle while simultaneously \u2018maintaining the trigger finger on the device\u2019s ledge with constant rearward pressure.\u2019\u201d",

	"text": "This is one of those stretches when you may want to avoid looking at your investments.Performance reports for the three months that ended in September are arriving now, and they are ugly. The vast majority of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds \u2014 the vehicles used by most Americans for their investments \u2014 fell. There were losses in most markets and in nearly all asset classes.If you\u2019ve lost money, take some deep breaths, practice yoga, watch a ballgame, enjoy time with family and friends \u2014 whatever works. But don\u2019t make abrupt changes in your investments. A good plan is better than an emotional response when markets fall.I say all that assuming you already have a solid investment portfolio set up \u2014 a simple one, ideally, containing cheap funds, preferably index funds that mirror the total market.If you don\u2019t have a solid plan yet, a downturn is a great time to start. Most basically, stock and bond prices will be lower than they were just a short time earlier.\nBut invest for the long term. Hold diversified stock funds for higher returns and bond funds for income and stability (though bonds haven\u2019t been paragons of stability lately), and stick with them. Stash the money you need to pay the bills in money-market funds, short-term savings accounts and Treasury bills.Keep your costs low and hold broadly diversified investments for years to come. For most people, that\u2019s a much better bet than stock-picking and frequent trading, numerous studies show.This approach requires the ability to withstand losses, though, and that ability is being tested now.Nasty NumbersThe average domestic stock fund in the Morningstar database declined 3.5 percent for the quarter. The average taxable bond fund fell 1.1 percent. The average municipal bond fund fell 3.3 percent. As a group, internationally oriented stock funds fared even worse. They declined 4.7 percent.Furthermore, core stock and bond indexes that function as benchmarks \u2014 and, in some cases, are the foundation \u2014 for many mutual funds and E.T.F.s. fell during the quarter.\nDividends included, the S&P 500 stock index lost 3.3 percent for the three months through September.These numbers aren\u2019t shocking in themselves. What makes them painful, however, is that they come after the markets had begun recovering from the steep declines of last year.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.It shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising when the stock market falls. Such declines have made headlines for decades. But bonds are different. They have a reputation for steady, even stodgy performance. The latest returns undercut those assumptions.For the last quarter, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index (it was once the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Index) lost 3.2 percent, including dividends, nearly as much as the S&P 500. What\u2019s worse, over three years, this core bond index lost nearly 15 percent, including interest paid out in dividends, while the S&P 500 gained about 34 percent.Those returns understate the bond market carnage. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Index, which tracks long-term Treasuries, lost 13 percent for the quarter \u2014 and about 42 percent for the three years through September, including dividends.You don\u2019t need to worry about individual, high-quality bonds if you hold them to maturity. But if you trade them while market interest rates rise, you can incur serious losses.\nWhat Causes the Losses?A major shift in interest rates caused the pain in the bond market and hurt stocks, too.Recall that during the first stage of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve dropped the short-term federal funds rate to nearly zero in a bid to support the ravaged economy. Then, after inflation became red hot, it began raising short-term rates early last year in an effort to put out the inflation fire. It isn\u2019t done yet.Longer-term rates in the bond market didn\u2019t rise as much or as quickly at first \u2014 perhaps signaling an eventual recession \u2014 but longer-term bond rates have been shooting up lately.Interest rate increases have caused automatic declines in bond prices. That\u2019s a function of bond math. Yields and prices move in opposite directions, so rising interest rates have translated into falling bond prices, especially for securities of longer duration.For stocks, the effects of rising rates are more complicated. For one thing, utilities and high dividend-paying stocks have been hit hard because their chief virtue \u2014 their ability to generate income \u2014 doesn\u2019t look nearly as attractive now that high-quality bonds offer reliable payouts of more than 5 percent annually. Beyond that, corporate costs have risen with higher interest rates, slightly impairing corporate earnings in the third quarter.Gains in the S&P 500 earlier in the year were based largely on investor optimism about future earnings growth. A.I. fever gripped the market, elevating stocks like Nvidia, which supplies computer chips that enable artificial intelligence programs to operate. Nvidia was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 for the calendar year through September, with a total return of nearly 198 percent.\nBut the market\u2019s mood has become dour as the Fed has signaled it intends to hold interest rates \u201chigher for longer.\u201dIn September, Nvidia shares flagged, however, with a decline for the month of 11.9 percent.The stock market is top-heavy, depending disproportionately on a handful of big companies. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 accounted for nearly 70 percent of the index\u2019s price increase for the calender year through September, according to Bespoke Investment Group. These are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Nvidia, Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly and Visa.When some of these stocks faltered in the third quarter, they pulled the market down with them. Apple declined 11.7 percent during the quarter. Because it is weighted so heavily in the S&P 500, it was responsible for one-fourth of the entire index\u2019s decline, Birinyi Associates calculated.Hurting and HelpingEnergy prices rose in the quarter, and that\u2019s caused a variety of problems. Gasoline has been getting expensive again, and higher energy costs are rippling through the economy, complicating the Fed\u2019s battle against inflation, while weighing on the profits of companies that are net energy consumers.But for some investors, there has been a bright side. Higher prices for energy are a boon for stocks and funds that focus on fossil fuel.\nCompare these stock returns for the quarter:Exxon Mobil, the oil giant, up 9.6 percent.Marathon Petroleum, the nation\u2019s largest petroleum refiner, up 29.8 percent.Solar Edge, which calls itself \u201ca visionary leader in smart energy technology, committed to harnessing the power of the sun to create a sustainable future,\u201d lost 51.9 percent, the worst quarterly performance in the S&P 500.Profiting from higher fossil fuel prices is less than ideal if you are worried about climate change. Yet the economy still depends on fossil fuels. And even if alternative energy comes to dominate the future, oil and gas are generating riches now.Energy stock funds focused mainly on fossil fuels rose 10.4 percent for the three months through September, according to Morningstar, and funds like Vanguard Energy Index Fund and Fidelity Advisor Energy Fund gained more than 13 percent. Exxon was the biggest holding in these funds.Energy \u2014 fossil fuel or alternative \u2014 has come in and out of favor, and prices have dropped in October. Where they head next is anybody\u2019s guess.OnwardMore broadly, where interest rates and inflation are going \u2014 and whether the economy will plunge into a recession \u2014 are crucial questions without reliable answers. I\u2019d be skeptical of anyone who claims to know.Predicting commodity, stock or bond prices is hazardous, at best. You can make big profits if you bet correctly, but you will be taking big risks.\nUnless you do this for a living, I wouldn\u2019t go there. Instead, for long-term investing, it\u2019s far more sensible for most people to seek absolutely average returns, without trying to pick favorites or time the movements of the markets.Just being average has been a solid strategy. Since November 2000, despite numerous crises and downturns, a basic investment with 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds in broad U.S. market index funds returned nearly 300 percent.To capture that return, you needed to have kept fees to a minimum, to have held diversified index funds and to have disregarded market dips like this one.There will be further storms ahead, and big ones. Try to prepare for them, and prosper.",

	"text": "After a year spent parsing Federal Reserve chair Jerome H. Powell\u2019s comments for clues about the direction of interest rates, some stock investors are going their own way.On Wednesday, despite Mr. Powell announcing a 0.25 percentage point increase in rates, pledging that there are more to come, and suggesting that rates won\u2019t be cut at all in 2023, the S&P 500 rose 1 percent. The gains added to a rally that\u2019s lifted shares by more than 7 percent this year.In the bond market, Treasury yields, indicative of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government and a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, fell.This is not how things have gone for most of the past year: Rising interest rates raise costs for consumers and companies, and the prospect of more increases has typically triggered stock market declines.\nBut lately, investors have latched on to signs that inflation is slowing, encouraging many to forecast that the end of the Fed\u2019s rate increases is near, even as the central bank has warned that their fight against inflation is far from over.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Trading on Wednesday illustrated the growing dissonance between investors and the Fed. Going by the market\u2019s move, it appears that investors are increasingly distrustful of the Fed\u2019s own forecasts.\u201cHe did say ongoing hikes but I still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. Mr. Brenner believes the rate increase made Wednesday will be the Fed\u2019s last. He said the market had lost faith in the Fed\u2019s forecasts after a year in which interest rates unexpectedly rose 4.5 percentage points. \u201cThis Fed has been more wrong than right and I think you can fight the Fed,\u201d he said.Mr. Brenner is not alone in his prediction. Though most investors are still forecasting another 0.25 percentage point rate increase in March, that outlook \u2014 reflected in trading in futures markets \u2014 is still below the Fed\u2019s own forecasts for two more quarter-point raises. Markets are also pricing in a cut in interest rates later this year, something Mr. Powell tried to rule out on Wednesday.\u201cI just don\u2019t see us cutting rates this year,\u201d he said.Investors weren\u2019t moved. The 10-year Treasury yield, which underpins borrowing costs around the world, fell 0.1 percentage points on Wednesday to 3.42 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, also fell 0.1 percent points to 4.12 percent.\nTechnology stocks, among the worst performing in 2022 because of their sensitivity to higher interest rates, have rallied this year. The Nasdaq Composite, stuffed full of technology stocks, jumped 2 percent on Wednesday. It has climbed nearly 13 percent this year, notching its best start to a year since 2001.Our business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Still, the stock-market rally Wednesday is not going to be the final word on this matter.Rising stock prices and falling bond yields have created a problem for the Fed, enriching investors and making it easier for them to borrow, undercutting efforts to pull down still high inflation.\u201cThis loosening of financial conditions is undoubtedly not what the Fed was aiming for, and we expect a cacophony of Fed speeches in the coming weeks will aim to reorient the Fed\u2019s message,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, Ernst & Young\u2019s strategy consulting arm. \u201cIn other words, the infernal tango will continue as the Fed and markets try to find synchronized rhythms once again.\u201dThe last time stocks began to rise markedly, over the summer last year, Mr. Powell had to publicly warn that the fight against inflation was far from over. His caution then was enough to send stock prices sharply lower again.This time, Mr. Powell struck a more balanced tone, acknowledging the resilience of the economy and that he still expects it to grow this year. He said that investors appear to think inflation will fall more quickly than the Fed expects, allowing the central bank to reduce interest rates sooner.\n\u201cWe have a different view, a different forecast really,\u201d said Mr. Powell, noting that the central bank is willing to adjust its policy if it is wrong.The jump in stock prices this year has left some investors worried that markets are being too optimistic, with the Fed\u2019s impact on the economy, consumers and companies still to be fully realized. And if Mr. Powell is unsatisfied with the markets\u2019 response, he will get another chance to set things straight when he speaks at the Economic Club of New York next week.\u201cWe are shifting toward asking, how much damage has the Fed done?\u201d said Chris Murphy, a derivatives strategist at Susquehanna International Group. \u201cI think investors are underappreciating that.\u201d",

	"text": "This week, officials are expected to shut down all commercial and recreational salmon fishing off California for 2023. Much will be canceled off neighboring Oregon, too.The reason: An alarming decline of fish stocks linked to the one-two punch of heavily engineered waterways and the supercharged heat and drought that come with climate change. There are new threats in the ocean, too, that are less understood but may be tied to global warming, according to researchers.Scientists and fishers had been braced for bad numbers. Conditions were terrible a couple of years earlier, when the salmon were young and tiny in low, overheated creeks and rivers in California. But as the fish counts came in and the models spit out figures, the numbers were even more dismal than expected.Of all the salmon in California, fall-run Chinook were the last ones robust enough for commercial fishing. But this year, fewer than 170,000 are expected to return to Central Valley rivers. That\u2019s down from highs of over a million as recently as 1995.\nWhile some dips are normal, this one is not.\u201cCalifornia salmon are in dire straits,\u201d said Nate Mantua, a climate scientist who leads a team of salmon ecologists and biologists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Fisheries in Santa Cruz, Calif.The shutdown would mean higher prices and no fresh local salmon in California this year, though it probably would have little or no effect beyond the region.Salmon are hardy survivors that have lived on Earth far longer than humans. They migrate hundreds of miles from the freshwater creeks where they hatch to the salty ocean and back again, leaping up waterfalls on the return trip. But what\u2019s happening in California and Oregon, at the southern end of the range, scientists say, may be a harbinger of what\u2019s to come in cooler waters farther north.\u201cMost of the salmon populations around the entire Pacific Rim have been doing very, very poorly,\u201d Dr. Mantua said.\nPacific salmon will still be harvested off parts of Oregon, Washington and Alaska. It\u2019s a complicated picture. Some varieties, like sockeye in Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay, are booming. But some Chinook stocks farther north have collapsed. Overall, scientists say, the picture is grim.The assault on California salmon started two centuries ago. First fur traders wiped out beavers, whose dams created exceptional salmon habitat. Then came the Gold Rush, with hydraulic mining that choked creeks with gravel. Settlers drained and channelized the vast California delta and beyond. Next came dams, those engineering marvels that supplied water for a growing population and turned California into an agricultural powerhouse. In the process of all that, California lost about 90 percent of its wetlands.Latest News on Climate Change\u00a0and the EnvironmentCard 1 of 5Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The island\u2019s expansive ice sheet is known to be shrinking, especially since the 1990s, because of warming from climate change. Now, a new study reveals that about 20% more of the Greenland ice sheet has disappeared\u00a0than previous estimates show, potentially threatening ocean currents that help to regulate global temperatures.Droughts around the world. The U.N. estimates that 1.84 billion people worldwide, or nearly a quarter of humanity, were living under drought in 2022 and 2023, the vast majority in low- and middle-income countries. The crisis, worsened partly by climate change, has been accompanied by soaring food prices and could have consequences for hunger, elections and migration.U.S. carbon emissions fall. America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions fell 1.9% in 2023, in large part because the burning of coal to produce electricity plummeted to its lowest level in half a century, according to new research. Still, the decline in emissions to date hasn\u2019t been nearly steep enough to meet that nation\u2019s goals for trying to slow global warming.High-cost disasters. The United States experienced 28 disasters in 2023 that each cost at least $1 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the highest number on record and the latest measure of the growing financial toll of climate change. The previous record was 2020, which saw 22 billion-dollar events.A year of record heat. It\u2019s official: 2023 was Earth\u2019s hottest year by far in a century and a half. To climate scientists, it comes as no surprise that unabated emissions of greenhouse gases\u00a0caused global warming to reach new highs. The big question is whether 2023 foretells more years in which heat records are not merely broken, but smashed.The reshaping of water flows cut off salmon from the mountain rivers where they cooled off in summer and from the floodplains, rich with bugs, where they packed on weight in winter. The loss of these and other habitats means the fish are less able to cope with the latest attack: climate change, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels.\nWhile recent rain and snow in California may help salmon rebound in three years, when the fish from this year\u2019s eggs are ready to be harvested in the ocean, the intensity of the flooding comes with downsides. Raging torrents can scour the riverbeds where salmon lay their eggs.People who rely on the fish are facing a painful reality.Keith Parker, senior fisheries biologist for the Yurok Tribe, whose members fish along the Klamath River in California, called the situation tragic. \u201cWe lost our language,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cWe lost our religion for a long time. We lost our fish. So, we lost a lot.\u201d When the fish are plentiful, Mr. Parker said, you can see a difference in people. \u201cOur community is much happier, it\u2019s healthier,\u201d he said. \u201cMental health is better.\u201dThe commercial salmon industry plans to request federal disaster relief. They don\u2019t just blame the drought; they blame the way water is allocated for agriculture.\u201cThere\u2019s been an ongoing war for years over water for salmon,\u201d said Glen Spain, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Associations. \u201cOur industry requires that water be left in the river. Big Ag has been trying to get the water out of the river into the fields.\u201dIt\u2019s an increasingly contentious issue in California politics.Many varieties of salmon are already listed as threatened or endangered in California, but a formidable hatchery effort in the Central Valley has kept fall-run Chinook, which return to California rivers in the autumn, strong enough for commercial and recreational fishing. But not this year.\nAlso known as king salmon, Chinook, with a high fat content and buttery taste, is generally the most valuable of Pacific salmon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad on two levels,\u201d said Sarah Bates, who fishes for salmon out of San Francisco. \u201cThe loss of income and loss of work is upsetting, but the deeper understanding of what\u2019s happening to our ecosystems and food resources is pretty devastating.\u201dCentral Valley hatcheries raise about 30 million fall-run Chinook a year, which can be largely protected from poor conditions in the rivers. In bad years, young salmon are loaded into trucks and driven to the sea. But even those fish are disappearing.Scientists worry that hatchery efforts are backfiring in part by weakening salmon\u2019s genetic resilience. Once in the ocean, the fish face another slew of threats that are less understood.\nOcean forces were found to be a major factor in the only other total shutdowns of salmon fishing in California, which happened in 2008 and 2009. The ocean off California has, at times, already gotten as hot as climate change models predicted it would be at the end of the century, said Steve Lindley, fisheries ecology division director for NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. What saves salmon is an upwelling of nutrient-rich, cold water along the coast. But that upwelling was delayed in the mid-2000s, leaving the salmon with little food. They either starved or remained so small that they were picked off by seabirds, researchers found.Threats at sea are most likely playing a much smaller, but still notable, role in this year\u2019s dismal numbers, scientists say. One possible factor: Booming anchovy populations. In recent years, salmon have made anchovies a higher percentage of their diet. But anchovies contain an enzyme that breaks down thiamine, or vitamin B1, and salmon are becoming thiamine deficient. (Scientists connected the dots when baby fish started swimming upside down and dying. Infusing hatchery water with thiamine set them right.)What\u2019s becoming increasingly clear, according to scientists at NOAA Fisheries, is that the models used to predict stocks and manage fishing aren\u2019t working like they used to.\u201cWe keep getting surprised, even though we\u2019re trying to adjust expectations downward every year because of the previous surprises,\u201d Dr. Lindley said. That makes it harder to set fishing seasons and ensure fishers don\u2019t catch more than expected.To make matters worse, he said, an El Ni\u00f1o pattern is on the horizon, which could make the cold stream of water along the coast disappear. \u201cThis is what really scares some of us,\u201d Dr. Lindley said.\nGlobally, the ocean has absorbed more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped on the planet by greenhouse gases.\nWhat gives Dr. Lindley and other scientists hope are efforts to fix the underlying causes of salmon declines rather than the symptoms.\nFossil fuel emissions must be addressed, scientists say. Meanwhile, restoring habitat lets salmon do what they\u2019ve evolved to do: Offset risk by spreading it out over space and time. Even within a salmon species, different populations return to different parts of different rivers at different times of the year. Think of it like diversifying risk across an investment portfolio, said Daniel Schindler, a professor at the University of Washington who studies watersheds and fish.\u201cThe best thing we can do is give those fish the best chance they have to figure it out evolutionarily,\u201d Dr. Schindler said, which means giving them as many habitat options as possible.So there was joy on the Klamath River last month as crews broke ground on a megaproject to remove four old hydroelectric dams, which will give salmon access to more than 400 miles of historic habitat, including so-called thermal refuges like cold springs.\u201cEven though it\u2019s like the lowest salmon runs and it\u2019s horrible, on the other side of the coin, it\u2019s also one of the greatest years because in July the first dam is coming down,\u201d said Mr. Parker of the Yurok tribe, which has been pushing for the project along with other tribes, the fishing industry and conservation groups.Another bright spot is efforts in which salmon advocates are working with farmers to find win-win solutions, such as turning rice fields into temporary floodplains in the winter, when rain is more plentiful, and growing salmon on them. Research has shown the young fish can grow 10 times as big that way, feasting on a bug buffet that simply doesn\u2019t exist in the faster-flowing rivers, which leaves them better equipped to survive their next stage of life in the ocean.\nAt the same time, the effort recharges groundwater and fertilizes the rice fields.Much of the water conflict in California, which is often framed as farmers versus fish, is actually the result of systems built long ago, when we knew far less about how rivers work, said Jacob Katz, a senior scientist with California Trout, a nonprofit group focused on restoring California\u2019s waterways.\u201cYou get this idea that it\u2019s an inevitable trade-off between agricultural production and wildlife production,\u201d Dr. Katz said. \u201cAnd what we see is that\u2019s not the case, that there is an incredible amount of middle ground.\u201d",

	"text": "Stocks nudged higher in choppy trading on Monday, as investors cautiously welcomed moves to shore up the global financial system after the collapse of four banks set off turmoil in financial markets this month.The S&P 500 rose 0.9 percent, with every sector of the index ending up for the day. Monday\u2019s bounce came a day after Swiss authorities arranged a hasty takeover of the nation\u2019s embattled lender, Credit Suisse, by its rival, UBS. Major central banks also moved on Sunday to make dollar funding more readily available, and federal regulators announced an acquisition of parts of the collapsed Signature Bank in New York.Those efforts brought some relief to worried investors, even as they remained mindful that more turmoil could yet emerge. Already, analysts are concerned about the potential knock-on impact to the economy that could come as banks pull back from lending in order to insulate themselves from any further fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.The cautious tone on Monday also came a day before the Federal Reserve begins a crucial meeting. The Fed has been raising interest rates to rein in stubbornly higher inflation, but the volatility\u00a0in the banking sector has led to a complete reassessment of what the central bank will do next as investors worry about policymakers further turning the screws on an economy already showing signs of stress.\nTraders are evenly split on whether the central bank will raise interest rates at all when it announces a decision on Wednesday, a sharp change from just a few weeks ago, when many in markets expected the Fed to increase the rate\u00a0by half a percentage point\u00a0in response to hotter than expected inflation data.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Economists at Goldman Sachs said on Monday that they now expected the Fed to hold off raising rates this week \u201cbecause of stress in the banking system.\u201dThat stress was still evident in shares of some small banks. Notably, First Republic Bank, the target of a rescue attempt by larger rivals that injected billions in deposits into the lender\u00a0last week, slid nearly 50 percent on Monday. Its stock has dropped 90 percent this month, erasing tens of billions of dollars of market value and putting its future as an independent bank in doubt. First Republic\u2019s credit rating was downgraded by S&P Global on Sunday, for the second time in less than a week.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Another relatively small lender, Western Alliance, also tumbled. Its shares fell 6.7 percent after initially starting the day with a gain.In Zurich, Credit Suisse\u2019s share price slumped over 50 percent after its deal with UBS, which was agreed at a hefty discount to Credit Suisse\u2019s market value on Friday. Shares of\u00a0UBS gained more than 3 percent.\nSome American banks that have wavered after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank fared better on Monday. Shares of PacWest rose, as did Comerica and Zions Bank.Yet even as the volatile trading conditions in financial markets appeared to be easing, the fallout from the recent rout was still being felt by some investors.One strategy that has been particular hard hit by the recent turbulence is that of Commodity Trading Advisors. The strategy is employed by some of the largest investment funds in the world and follows the momentum of markets, buying as prices rise and selling as they fall. This makes these funds susceptible to sharp changes that can catch them off guard. An index of the 20 largest CTA managers run by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has fallen nearly 9 percent since the sell-off began.In debt markets, the Credit Suisse deal caused unease that some investors worried could linger because it upended the normal hierarchy in which investors\u00a0were paid back when a company faltered. Investors who own stock in a company are typically last in line to be paid when a company is wiped out. But in this case, owners of stock in Credit Suisse received one UBS share for every 22.48 shares they owned, according to the terms of the deal.In contrast, a special form of risky bank debt, known as AT1 bonds, were wiped out. On Monday, banking regulators and supervisors in the European Union, of which Switzerland is not a member, issued a statement reiterating that in their jurisdiction shareholders bear losses at banks before bondholders. The price of other European AT1 bank debt slid on Monday.\u201cI think it was a mistake to mess with the AT1s,\u201d\u00a0Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, said. \u201cThey have made everyone question this market.\u201dJason Karaian and Kevin Granville contributed reporting.",

	"text": "The new movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d dramatizes the true story of an unlikely messiah named Roaring Kitty who decides to sink his life savings into shares of the video-game seller GameStop and then praise the stock to his fans. So many people buy GameStop shares that the company\u2019s valuation soars, crushing the positions of professional hedge funds that had bet against it. Thus, a band of lovable misfits triumphs over the Wall Street fat cats.Much as we enjoyed the movie, we are economists, not movie critics. And as practitioners of the dismal science, we worry that some viewers will continue to be inspired to copy the heroes\u2019 investment strategies, which is about as smart as driving home at 100 miles per hour after seeing \u201cThe Fast and the Furious.\u201dYou can see our worry in the movie\u2019s title: \u201cDumb Money.\u201d That\u2019s Wall Street parlance for unsophisticated individual investors who make mistakes that can be exploited. Is it nice to call the actions of everyday Joe investors dumb? No. Is it fair? Well \u2026 yes.We aren\u2019t literally calling retail investors dumb. What we are saying is that retail investors are smart people who unfortunately behave in dumb, self-destructive ways. Their actions reflect overconfidence, financial ignorance and a wealth-reducing love of gambling. Even smart people like Sir Isaac Newton can make dumb investment decisions (he lost money in the South Sea bubble).\nAnd in celebrating an unintelligent investment strategy in a moment when the stock market was reaching historic heights of stupidity, \u201cDumb Money\u201d raises an important question: Are American financial markets getting dumber over time? Or was this just a momentary lapse?We did see a prior peak of stock market dumbness in the 1999-2000 tech stock bubble, when many retail investors made the mistake of being wildly overoptimistic about technology stocks. One of us, Owen Lamont, has even co-written (with Andrea Frazzini) an academic paper titled, you guessed it, \u201cDumb Money,\u201d describing self-destructive investor behavior during this period. But compared to the events of the GameStop story, that crazy optimism seems almost rational, since it at least involved a correct thesis (that the internet would eventually produce some profitable companies), however stupidly applied.After the tech bubble burst a year or so later, U.S. stock markets were less obviously dumb until the Covid-19 lockdowns spurred a tsunami of retail investing, as enormous numbers of people were suddenly stuck at home with nothing to do and, importantly, nothing to bet on. Casinos were closed and professional sports were on hold. Meanwhile, brokers like Robinhood were offering the option of trading stocks commission-free.The gambling impulse was also goosed by stimulus checks and social media platforms like Reddit and YouTube. Money flowed to \u201cmeme stocks,\u201d shares of oftentimes struggling companies that somehow caught the popular imagination owing to nostalgia or the desire to root for the underdog. This brings us to GameStop, a meme stock whose rise at the start of 2021 \u2014 despite the company\u2019s dismal business outlook \u2014 was really also an expression of populist anger. Ordinary Americans wanted to bet on the home team (an army of individual investors) against that other team (sinister billionaires betting against America).Since GameStop, a suspiciously high number of other dumb things have occurred recently. Just this year, we\u2019ve seen bizarre price fluctuations of meme stocks that are in or approaching bankruptcy and in foreign companies listing in the United States. One possible culprit for this wave of global dumbening is social media, which played a big role in GameStop by facilitating investor herding.\nShould we throw up our hands and conclude that the whole stock market is crazy? No. These crazy incidents still remain confined to only a few stocks. Stock prices usually revert to fundamental value, although it may take years. When this happens, retail investors who overpaid and held on too long get hurt.Retail investors have a well-established track record of destroying their own wealth. Studies have shown that individual traders somehow have the opposite of skill \u2014 they manage to do worse than they would by picking stocks at random.Why? Investing is hard, and there is a lot of competition. There are thousands of actively managed mutual funds. Do you think the average golfer would have a chance against Tiger Woods in his prime?The ineptitude of individual investors is not for lack of trying. In fact, the harder that individual investors try (in the sense of trading more often), the more they lose. For example, the professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean found that women investors did better than men. Why? Because men traded more. (They titled their paper \u201cBoys Will Be Boys.\u201d) So the conclusion from this finding is not (necessarily) that men are dumber. They are just more aggressively and overconfidently manifesting their dumbness. Perhaps this idea will resonate with some readers.The wealth-destroying powers of retail investors have been demonstrated many times: in stocks, mutual funds and options markets; in different countries and in different time periods. The evidence from Taiwan, which has excellent data on stock market trading, is particularly striking. Mr. Barber and Mr. Odean, together with their co-authors Yi-Tsung Lee and Yu-Jane Liu, have shown that individual investors underperform other investors by nearly 4 percent per year and that these losses are equivalent to about 2 percent of Taiwan\u2019s G.D.P.\nIf retail investors are the dumb money, who\u2019s the smart money? The answer includes skeptics who can spot a company\u2019s shortcomings and express their views by either selling their shares or betting that share prices will fall in a practice called short selling.Although \u201cDumb Money\u201d depicts professional hedge fund investors as heartless villains who treat a pet pig better than their housekeepers, it would be wrong for movie audiences to think that selling short is inherently bad. As we saw in the movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which depicts a band of misfit short sellers spotting major problems in the U.S. financial system before its near collapse in 2008, these investors can also be lovable \u2014 even heroes. (Full disclosure: We may be biased about \u201cThe Big Short\u201d because one of us had a small part in the movie, while the other is jealous about that fact.)We certainly hope that over time, widespread meme stock investing will go the way of toilet paper hoarding and people will go back to rooting for the Red Sox versus the Yankees (or vice versa) instead of Roaring Kitty versus hedge funds. We hope that citizens concerned about inequality will express themselves in the voting booth, not in the stock market. And we hope that retail investors confine their gambling to small stakes, like buying lottery tickets or placing wagers on their favorite teams.Ask any finance professor and you\u2019ll get the same boring answer: The best way for most people to invest in the long term is to hold a diversified portfolio of stocks. Admittedly, a movie about a bunch of ordinary people gradually building wealth through prudent financial decisions would be the world\u2019s most boring movie. Boring, but also not dumb.\nOwen A.

	"text": "It\u2019s dawning on stock investors that they were wrong about the Federal Reserve.After rallying behind a resilient economy, slowing inflation and the hope that the central bank would end its interest-rate increases sooner than it had communicated, stock trading has grown jittery.The S&P 500 has lost its momentum in February, after a drop this week that left it 2.4 percent lower than its peak early in the month. Stocks have oscillated between gains and losses as new economic data have clouded the outlook for investors, marking a notable shift in the market after stocks jumped more than 6 percent in January.The change in tone this week came as a steady flow of data has shown the economy continued to run hot in January. Despite high-profile layoffs at big technology firms like Meta and Microsoft, employers in the United States continued to hire at a rapid clip, consumers kept spending and prices continued to rise briskly at the start of the year across an array of goods and services.All those data points suggest that the economy retains significant vigor, even after a year of rapid policy adjustments aimed at cooling down the economy. Fed officials had repeatedly warned that there was more work to do to slow rising prices, but investors had hoped that a slowdown in inflation that took hold in earnest late last year would allow policymakers to hit pause on their rate adjustments sooner than they had predicted. Now, mounting evidence that the economy remains surprisingly strong and price increases unexpectedly stubborn have begun undercutting that narrative.\nIn response, investors have sharply raised their expectations for the number of times the Fed will increase interest rates in the coming months. And even central bankers themselves have begun to float the possibility that rates will need to climb higher than they previously expected if the economy does not cool down. Higher interest rates raise costs for consumers and companies, slowing demand and typically weighing on the stock market.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cI\u2019m very negative right now on equities,\u201d said Eric Johnston, the head of equity derivatives at Cantor Fitzgerald, who predicted the recent S&P 500 rally but now expects a slump. \u201cI think the move we have seen in the rate market, some of the inflation numbers that have come out and the expectation that the economy will be fine is all fairly problematic.\u201dMr. Johnston now thinks the S&P 500 will eventually fall below its 2022 low, a drop of more than 10 percent from current levels. Strategists at Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase are also among those bracing for a fall.Bond investors had been quicker to shift their view.At the start of this month, investors betting on the path of interest rates predicted the Fed would raise its benchmark rate just once more this year, by a quarter of a percentage point in March.\nNow, those traders are leaning to three increases of that size, through July, which would take the Fed\u2019s target rate to a range of 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent. That\u2019s above the Fed\u2019s own most recent forecasts, published in December.\nBut policymakers have also hinted that their own estimates could be poised for revision if the economy continues to run hotter than previously anticipated. Our business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.John C. Williams, president of the powerful Federal Reserve Bank of New York, suggested this week that rates were likely to rise to a range of 5 percent to 5.5 percent \u2014 slightly above the 5 percent to 5.25 percent median in the central bank\u2019s December forecast. He and several of his colleagues have said they may need to do even more than that if consumption and the labor market remain so robust.\u201cWith the strength in the labor market, clearly there\u2019s risks that inflation stays higher for longer than expected or that we might need to raise rates higher than that,\u201d Mr. Williams told reporters in New York this week.Loretta Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, said during a speech on Thursday that \u201cwe may very well have to move higher, hold it longer at that peak rate or even change what we do at any particular meeting\u201d if economic pressures kept inflation elevated.\nGiven recent data, economists at Goldman Sachs and Bank of America changed their forecasts on Thursday. They are now predicting that the Fed would raise rates to 5.25 percent to 5.5 percent this year \u2014 a quarter point higher than either bank had previously estimated.\u201cThe Fed might have to hike further if inflation, job growth and consumer demand refuse to soften,\u201d Michael Gapen at Bank of America wrote in a research note explaining the shift.For investors, the possibility of more rate moves has rekindled the fear that the Fed\u2019s campaign will push the economy into a downturn. It\u2019s an about-face from the more optimistic view that had taken hold in financial markets at the start of the year, that inflation could fall while the economy continued to grow.\u201cWe had just got comfortable with what the Fed told us it was going to do two weeks ago, and already we are having to rethink that,\u201d David Donabedian, the chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth US, said, referring to the recent Fed meeting. \u201cThe momentum in the market has stopped.\u201d",

	"text": "Stocks and bonds rallied on Friday, extending a sharp reversal after fresh data about the health of the U.S. labor market capped a tumultuous week for investors.The 10-year government bond yield, which underpins rates on everything from mortgages to business loans, dropped 0.1 percentage points on Friday, another large decline for a market in which daily moves are measured in hundredths of a point. Yields move inversely to prices.A new report showed that the U.S. economy added fewer-than-expected jobs in October, a sign of a cooling labor market that could reduce the need for the Federal Reserve to raise its key rate again as it aims to slow the economy to fight inflation.That helped to lift the stock market, which had sold off as rates rose in recent months. The S&P 500 ended the week almost 6 percent higher, recording its best week of the year.\nThe Fed started raising its key short-term rate in March last year, but investors more recently had become fixated on longer-dated market rates, which are driven by a variety of factors like economic growth and inflation expectations, not just the Fed\u2019s policy decisions. These long-term rates began surging in August, intensifying concerns about the sustainability of the government\u2019s $33 trillion debt pile, among other worries.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Those concerns dissipated somewhat this week. Investors welcomed plans from the Treasury Department to skew its borrowing toward shorter-term debt, taking pressure off longer-dated yields. Then, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, appeared to soothe investors\u2019 nerves after the central bank held rates steady for a second consecutive meeting. Weaker-than-expected job growth further suggested that the Fed\u2019s efforts to slow the economy were having an effect.\u201cTo me, the jobs report is an unquestionable positive,\u201d said Ronald Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard. \u201cI think it\u2019s a really good signal to the Fed that they are slowing the economy and that they don\u2019t need to raise rates again.\u201d\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The 10-year Treasury yield fell 0.3 percentage points for the week to a little below 4.6 percent, its largest drop since the banking turmoil in March. Still, the yield remains more than half a percentage point higher than it was at the start of August.This week\u2019s dip in yields set off a broad rally across stock markets. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies, which are more sensitive to the ebb and flow of the economy, rose 2.8 percent on Friday. That index had fallen over 18 percent in recent months, but this week rallied back roughly 8 percent, its biggest one-week surge since the early pandemic recovery in 2020.\nStill, some investors warned that the market reaction might not reflect such a rosy story. The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9 percent in October, from 3.8 percent the previous month, while the number of people working or actively looking for work nudged lower.\u201cWhat concerns me is when we see such an increase in the unemployment rate, it tends to trend higher,\u201d said Blerina Uruci, chief U.S. economist at T. Rowe Price. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m monitoring closely. Otherwise, the slowdown in employment looks orderly.\u201dAfter the jobs report, investors dialed down the likelihood of the Fed raising interest rates at its next meeting, in December, and brought forward expectations of rate cuts next year, a sign that they believed the Fed was done increasing rates and that the economy would continue to slow.Mr. Powell, the Fed chair, said on Wednesday that the recent increase in long-term interest rates, which also raises borrowing costs and slows the economy, would need to be \u201cpersistent\u201d for it to play a role in convincing policymakers not to raise their key policy rate again.But if the recent reversal in the bond market persists and yields continue to fall, then \u201cironically\u201d it could make the Fed more likely to raise its rate in December, said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at the asset manager BlueBay, because it will lower borrowing costs and ease the brakes on the economy.\nAnd while a slowing economy would be expected to lower longer-term rates over time, worries over who will buy the deluge of debt the U.S. government is set to issue could push rates in the opposite direction.\u201cThere are two opposite forces at work,\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cOne is the slowing economy, which is entrenched now and that will bring yields down. But over time, the Treasury will issue more debt and those yields will go back up again. We are in a cross-current right now.\u201dJeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After several twists and turns this year, stock investors are in a celebratory mood. The S&P 500 set a new high for the year on Friday, a day after clocking its best month of 2023 in November, in a rally that quickly erased the benchmark index\u2019s steep drop over the summer.The reversal has come as investors have cheered signs that the Federal Reserve has finished raising interest rates, the primary tool in the central bank\u2019s effort to slow inflation. Those high rates have been a drag on corporate valuations because they raise costs for consumers and companies and give allure to investments outside the stock market.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, appeared to add to investors\u2019 bullish mood on Friday, suggesting that the economy continues to cool as expected.\u201cWe\u2019re getting what we wanted to get, we now have the ability to move carefully,\u201d Mr. Powell said at an event.\nWith a 0.6 percent rise on Friday, the S&P 500 nudged past the previous high for the year, set at the end of July. The index has risen over 10 percent from its late October low. This week was the fifth straight weekly gain for the index, its longest winning streak since June.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Investors have also been encouraged that the rally has been broad based. It has been driven by the large technology companies that dominate the index but has also been backed up by a rise in over 80 percent of the stocks in the index in the past month.Overall, the S&P 500 has risen nearly 20 percent this year, surprising many analysts who had predicted at the start of 2023 that the index would extend its struggle from 2022, when it fell by around 20 percent. The rally in November has left the index just 4 percent below its highest-ever level, which many consider the bar that must be surpassed to confirm a new bull market.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.As inflation has continued to cool, pockets of weakness in the economy have given the Fed pause, as officials attempt to slow rising prices without tipping the country into a severe downturn. Fed officials held interest rates steady at their meeting last month to allow the rate increases so far to fully work through the economy.Investors have welcomed the central bank\u2019s caution after fears mounted over the summer that the resilience of the economy \u2014 which grew at a swift 5.2 percent pace in the three months through September \u2014 would prompt the Fed to raise rates even further, and keep them elevated for a long time.\nThe 10-year Treasury yield, one of the most important interest rates in the world, has fallen almost 0.8 percentage points since its peak in October, to around 4.2 percent, a huge move in that market. That decline has pulled down borrowing costs that track the 10-year yield, like mortgage rates, and helped push stocks higher.The slide has undone some of the rise in Treasury yields that unnerved investors over the summer, dragging the S&P 500 from its July high.On Friday, the S&P 500\u2019s rally coincided with a sharp drop in two-year Treasury yields, which are sensitive to investors\u2019 changing interest expectations.But some analysts and investors have cautioned that the rise in the S&P 500 is not representative of the precarious position many companies across the country find themselves in. Even if the Fed refrains from raising rates further, they say, a long period of keeping rates at their current, elevated level could still cause pain for corporate America.The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies in the United States, which lack the scale of the giants in the S&P 500 and tend to feel the effects of interest-rate shifts and economic wobbles more sharply, remains roughly 9 percent below its level at the end of July, and up just 4 percent for the year.",

	"text": "The Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide whether the Trump administration had acted lawfully in banning bump stocks, the attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts.In Supreme Court briefs, the Biden administration urged the justices to uphold the ban, endorsing a rare move by the Trump administration to curtail gun violence after a mass shooting in Las Vegas in 2017.That October, a gunman armed with such a device opened fire at a music festival, killing 58 people and wounding hundreds of others.After the shootings, Justice Department officials initially said that the executive branch did not have the authority to ban bump stocks without congressional action. The department later changed course, determining it could ban the devices on its own.\nThe case concerns executive power, not the Second Amendment. Challengers have argued that the regulation, which went into effect in 2019, was not authorized by federal laws that largely ban machine guns.The National Firearms Act of 1934 defines a machine gun as \u201cany weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\u201d The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded the definition to include parts that can be used to convert a weapon into a machine gun.Lawyers for the government told the Supreme Court that bump stocks may be regulated under those laws.\u201cLike other machine guns, rifles modified with bump stocks are capable of firing hundreds of bullets per minute,\u201d said one brief in the case, Garland v. Cargill, No. 22-976.Quoting earlier findings, the brief said that \u201cthe Las Vegas mass shooter, for example, \u2018was able to fire several hundred rounds of ammunition in a short period of time\u2019 using bump stocks, \u2018killing 58 people and wounding approximately 500\u2019 in a matter of minutes.\u201d\nFederal appeals courts have issued conflicting rulings on whether the regulation was authorized by the laws. By one count, appeals courts have issued 22 opinions spanning some 350 pages.\u201cAnd yet,\u201d one of the challengers told the Supreme Court, \u201cthe purchase of 520,000 bump stocks, the expected loss of property in excess of $100 million, the lack of national uniformity in the sale and possession of bump stocks and the nonlegislative, unilateral criminalization of previously legal conduct all remain in controversy and dispute.\u201dBump stocks work by harnessing a firearm\u2019s recoil energy to allow it to keep firing after a single pull of the trigger. The Justice Department says this transforms semiautomatic weapons into machine guns subject to the federal laws.The challengers disagree. \u201cA weapon is not a machine gun if something more is required of the shooter than a single function of the trigger to produce more than one shot,\u201d a Supreme Court brief said. But, the brief added, \u201cthe shooter must do considerably more than pull the trigger once if he wishes the weapon to fire multiple shots.\u201dQuoting from the regulation, the challengers wrote that \u201cproducing a second shot requires the shooter to place \u2018forward pressure on the barrel-shroud or fore-grip of the rifle while simultaneously \u2018maintaining the trigger finger on the device\u2019s ledge with constant rearward pressure.\u2019\u201d",

	"text": "This is one of those stretches when you may want to avoid looking at your investments.Performance reports for the three months that ended in September are arriving now, and they are ugly. The vast majority of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds \u2014 the vehicles used by most Americans for their investments \u2014 fell. There were losses in most markets and in nearly all asset classes.If you\u2019ve lost money, take some deep breaths, practice yoga, watch a ballgame, enjoy time with family and friends \u2014 whatever works. But don\u2019t make abrupt changes in your investments. A good plan is better than an emotional response when markets fall.I say all that assuming you already have a solid investment portfolio set up \u2014 a simple one, ideally, containing cheap funds, preferably index funds that mirror the total market.If you don\u2019t have a solid plan yet, a downturn is a great time to start. Most basically, stock and bond prices will be lower than they were just a short time earlier.\nBut invest for the long term. Hold diversified stock funds for higher returns and bond funds for income and stability (though bonds haven\u2019t been paragons of stability lately), and stick with them. Stash the money you need to pay the bills in money-market funds, short-term savings accounts and Treasury bills.Keep your costs low and hold broadly diversified investments for years to come. For most people, that\u2019s a much better bet than stock-picking and frequent trading, numerous studies show.This approach requires the ability to withstand losses, though, and that ability is being tested now.Nasty NumbersThe average domestic stock fund in the Morningstar database declined 3.5 percent for the quarter. The average taxable bond fund fell 1.1 percent. The average municipal bond fund fell 3.3 percent. As a group, internationally oriented stock funds fared even worse. They declined 4.7 percent.Furthermore, core stock and bond indexes that function as benchmarks \u2014 and, in some cases, are the foundation \u2014 for many mutual funds and E.T.F.s. fell during the quarter.\nDividends included, the S&P 500 stock index lost 3.3 percent for the three months through September.These numbers aren\u2019t shocking in themselves. What makes them painful, however, is that they come after the markets had begun recovering from the steep declines of last year.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.It shouldn\u2019t be terribly surprising when the stock market falls. Such declines have made headlines for decades. But bonds are different. They have a reputation for steady, even stodgy performance. The latest returns undercut those assumptions.For the last quarter, the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index (it was once the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Index) lost 3.2 percent, including dividends, nearly as much as the S&P 500. What\u2019s worse, over three years, this core bond index lost nearly 15 percent, including interest paid out in dividends, while the S&P 500 gained about 34 percent.Those returns understate the bond market carnage. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury 20+ Year Index, which tracks long-term Treasuries, lost 13 percent for the quarter \u2014 and about 42 percent for the three years through September, including dividends.You don\u2019t need to worry about individual, high-quality bonds if you hold them to maturity. But if you trade them while market interest rates rise, you can incur serious losses.\nWhat Causes the Losses?A major shift in interest rates caused the pain in the bond market and hurt stocks, too.Recall that during the first stage of the pandemic, the Federal Reserve dropped the short-term federal funds rate to nearly zero in a bid to support the ravaged economy. Then, after inflation became red hot, it began raising short-term rates early last year in an effort to put out the inflation fire. It isn\u2019t done yet.Longer-term rates in the bond market didn\u2019t rise as much or as quickly at first \u2014 perhaps signaling an eventual recession \u2014 but longer-term bond rates have been shooting up lately.Interest rate increases have caused automatic declines in bond prices. That\u2019s a function of bond math. Yields and prices move in opposite directions, so rising interest rates have translated into falling bond prices, especially for securities of longer duration.For stocks, the effects of rising rates are more complicated. For one thing, utilities and high dividend-paying stocks have been hit hard because their chief virtue \u2014 their ability to generate income \u2014 doesn\u2019t look nearly as attractive now that high-quality bonds offer reliable payouts of more than 5 percent annually. Beyond that, corporate costs have risen with higher interest rates, slightly impairing corporate earnings in the third quarter.Gains in the S&P 500 earlier in the year were based largely on investor optimism about future earnings growth. A.I. fever gripped the market, elevating stocks like Nvidia, which supplies computer chips that enable artificial intelligence programs to operate. Nvidia was the biggest gainer in the S&P 500 for the calendar year through September, with a total return of nearly 198 percent.\nBut the market\u2019s mood has become dour as the Fed has signaled it intends to hold interest rates \u201chigher for longer.\u201dIn September, Nvidia shares flagged, however, with a decline for the month of 11.9 percent.The stock market is top-heavy, depending disproportionately on a handful of big companies. The 10 biggest stocks in the S&P 500 accounted for nearly 70 percent of the index\u2019s price increase for the calender year through September, according to Bespoke Investment Group. These are Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Nvidia, Meta (Facebook), Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Eli Lilly and Visa.When some of these stocks faltered in the third quarter, they pulled the market down with them. Apple declined 11.7 percent during the quarter. Because it is weighted so heavily in the S&P 500, it was responsible for one-fourth of the entire index\u2019s decline, Birinyi Associates calculated.Hurting and HelpingEnergy prices rose in the quarter, and that\u2019s caused a variety of problems. Gasoline has been getting expensive again, and higher energy costs are rippling through the economy, complicating the Fed\u2019s battle against inflation, while weighing on the profits of companies that are net energy consumers.But for some investors, there has been a bright side. Higher prices for energy are a boon for stocks and funds that focus on fossil fuel.\nCompare these stock returns for the quarter:Exxon Mobil, the oil giant, up 9.6 percent.Marathon Petroleum, the nation\u2019s largest petroleum refiner, up 29.8 percent.Solar Edge, which calls itself \u201ca visionary leader in smart energy technology, committed to harnessing the power of the sun to create a sustainable future,\u201d lost 51.9 percent, the worst quarterly performance in the S&P 500.Profiting from higher fossil fuel prices is less than ideal if you are worried about climate change. Yet the economy still depends on fossil fuels. And even if alternative energy comes to dominate the future, oil and gas are generating riches now.Energy stock funds focused mainly on fossil fuels rose 10.4 percent for the three months through September, according to Morningstar, and funds like Vanguard Energy Index Fund and Fidelity Advisor Energy Fund gained more than 13 percent. Exxon was the biggest holding in these funds.Energy \u2014 fossil fuel or alternative \u2014 has come in and out of favor, and prices have dropped in October. Where they head next is anybody\u2019s guess.OnwardMore broadly, where interest rates and inflation are going \u2014 and whether the economy will plunge into a recession \u2014 are crucial questions without reliable answers. I\u2019d be skeptical of anyone who claims to know.Predicting commodity, stock or bond prices is hazardous, at best. You can make big profits if you bet correctly, but you will be taking big risks.\nUnless you do this for a living, I wouldn\u2019t go there. Instead, for long-term investing, it\u2019s far more sensible for most people to seek absolutely average returns, without trying to pick favorites or time the movements of the markets.Just being average has been a solid strategy. Since November 2000, despite numerous crises and downturns, a basic investment with 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds in broad U.S. market index funds returned nearly 300 percent.To capture that return, you needed to have kept fees to a minimum, to have held diversified index funds and to have disregarded market dips like this one.There will be further storms ahead, and big ones. Try to prepare for them, and prosper.",

	"text": "After a year spent parsing Federal Reserve chair Jerome H. Powell\u2019s comments for clues about the direction of interest rates, some stock investors are going their own way.On Wednesday, despite Mr. Powell announcing a 0.25 percentage point increase in rates, pledging that there are more to come, and suggesting that rates won\u2019t be cut at all in 2023, the S&P 500 rose 1 percent. The gains added to a rally that\u2019s lifted shares by more than 7 percent this year.In the bond market, Treasury yields, indicative of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government and a benchmark for mortgages and other loans, fell.This is not how things have gone for most of the past year: Rising interest rates raise costs for consumers and companies, and the prospect of more increases has typically triggered stock market declines.\nBut lately, investors have latched on to signs that inflation is slowing, encouraging many to forecast that the end of the Fed\u2019s rate increases is near, even as the central bank has warned that their fight against inflation is far from over.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Trading on Wednesday illustrated the growing dissonance between investors and the Fed. Going by the market\u2019s move, it appears that investors are increasingly distrustful of the Fed\u2019s own forecasts.\u201cHe did say ongoing hikes but I still don\u2019t believe it,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. Mr. Brenner believes the rate increase made Wednesday will be the Fed\u2019s last. He said the market had lost faith in the Fed\u2019s forecasts after a year in which interest rates unexpectedly rose 4.5 percentage points. \u201cThis Fed has been more wrong than right and I think you can fight the Fed,\u201d he said.Mr. Brenner is not alone in his prediction. Though most investors are still forecasting another 0.25 percentage point rate increase in March, that outlook \u2014 reflected in trading in futures markets \u2014 is still below the Fed\u2019s own forecasts for two more quarter-point raises. Markets are also pricing in a cut in interest rates later this year, something Mr. Powell tried to rule out on Wednesday.\u201cI just don\u2019t see us cutting rates this year,\u201d he said.Investors weren\u2019t moved. The 10-year Treasury yield, which underpins borrowing costs around the world, fell 0.1 percentage points on Wednesday to 3.42 percent. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, also fell 0.1 percent points to 4.12 percent.\nTechnology stocks, among the worst performing in 2022 because of their sensitivity to higher interest rates, have rallied this year. The Nasdaq Composite, stuffed full of technology stocks, jumped 2 percent on Wednesday. It has climbed nearly 13 percent this year, notching its best start to a year since 2001.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Still, the stock-market rally Wednesday is not going to be the final word on this matter.Rising stock prices and falling bond yields have created a problem for the Fed, enriching investors and making it easier for them to borrow, undercutting efforts to pull down still high inflation.\u201cThis loosening of financial conditions is undoubtedly not what the Fed was aiming for, and we expect a cacophony of Fed speeches in the coming weeks will aim to reorient the Fed\u2019s message,\u201d said Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY Parthenon, Ernst & Young\u2019s strategy consulting arm. \u201cIn other words, the infernal tango will continue as the Fed and markets try to find synchronized rhythms once again.\u201dThe last time stocks began to rise markedly, over the summer last year, Mr. Powell had to publicly warn that the fight against inflation was far from over. His caution then was enough to send stock prices sharply lower again.This time, Mr. Powell struck a more balanced tone, acknowledging the resilience of the economy and that he still expects it to grow this year. He said that investors appear to think inflation will fall more quickly than the Fed expects, allowing the central bank to reduce interest rates sooner.\n\u201cWe have a different view, a different forecast really,\u201d said Mr. Powell, noting that the central bank is willing to adjust its policy if it is wrong.The jump in stock prices this year has left some investors worried that markets are being too optimistic, with the Fed\u2019s impact on the economy, consumers and companies still to be fully realized. And if Mr. Powell is unsatisfied with the markets\u2019 response, he will get another chance to set things straight when he speaks at the Economic Club of New York next week.\u201cWe are shifting toward asking, how much damage has the Fed done?\u201d said Chris Murphy, a derivatives strategist at Susquehanna International Group. \u201cI think investors are underappreciating that.\u201d",

	"text": "This week, officials are expected to shut down all commercial and recreational salmon fishing off California for 2023. Much will be canceled off neighboring Oregon, too.The reason: An alarming decline of fish stocks linked to the one-two punch of heavily engineered waterways and the supercharged heat and drought that come with climate change. There are new threats in the ocean, too, that are less understood but may be tied to global warming, according to researchers.Scientists and fishers had been braced for bad numbers. Conditions were terrible a couple of years earlier, when the salmon were young and tiny in low, overheated creeks and rivers in California. But as the fish counts came in and the models spit out figures, the numbers were even more dismal than expected.Of all the salmon in California, fall-run Chinook were the last ones robust enough for commercial fishing. But this year, fewer than 170,000 are expected to return to Central Valley rivers. That\u2019s down from highs of over a million as recently as 1995.\nWhile some dips are normal, this one is not.\u201cCalifornia salmon are in dire straits,\u201d said Nate Mantua, a climate scientist who leads a team of salmon ecologists and biologists at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association Fisheries in Santa Cruz, Calif.The shutdown would mean higher prices and no fresh local salmon in California this year, though it probably would have little or no effect beyond the region.Salmon are hardy survivors that have lived on Earth far longer than humans. They migrate hundreds of miles from the freshwater creeks where they hatch to the salty ocean and back again, leaping up waterfalls on the return trip. But what\u2019s happening in California and Oregon, at the southern end of the range, scientists say, may be a harbinger of what\u2019s to come in cooler waters farther north.\u201cMost of the salmon populations around the entire Pacific Rim have been doing very, very poorly,\u201d Dr. Mantua said.\nPacific salmon will still be harvested off parts of Oregon, Washington and Alaska. It\u2019s a complicated picture. Some varieties, like sockeye in Alaska\u2019s Bristol Bay, are booming. But some Chinook stocks farther north have collapsed. Overall, scientists say, the picture is grim.The assault on California salmon started two centuries ago. First fur traders wiped out beavers, whose dams created exceptional salmon habitat. Then came the Gold Rush, with hydraulic mining that choked creeks with gravel. Settlers drained and channelized the vast California delta and beyond. Next came dams, those engineering marvels that supplied water for a growing population and turned California into an agricultural powerhouse. In the process of all that, California lost about 90 percent of its wetlands.Latest News on Climate Change\u00a0and the EnvironmentCard 1 of 5Greenland\u2019s ice sheet. The island\u2019s expansive ice sheet is known to be shrinking, especially since the 1990s, because of warming from climate change. Now, a new study reveals that about 20% more of the Greenland ice sheet has disappeared\u00a0than previous estimates show, potentially threatening ocean currents that help to regulate global temperatures.Droughts around the world. The U.N. estimates that 1.84 billion people worldwide, or nearly a quarter of humanity, were living under drought in 2022 and 2023, the vast majority in low- and middle-income countries. The crisis, worsened partly by climate change, has been accompanied by soaring food prices and could have consequences for hunger, elections and migration.U.S. carbon emissions fall. America\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions fell 1.9% in 2023, in large part because the burning of coal to produce electricity plummeted to its lowest level in half a century, according to new research. Still, the decline in emissions to date hasn\u2019t been nearly steep enough to meet that nation\u2019s goals for trying to slow global warming.High-cost disasters. The United States experienced 28 disasters in 2023 that each cost at least $1 billion, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the highest number on record and the latest measure of the growing financial toll of climate change. The previous record was 2020, which saw 22 billion-dollar events.A year of record heat. It\u2019s official: 2023 was Earth\u2019s hottest year by far in a century and a half. To climate scientists, it comes as no surprise that unabated emissions of greenhouse gases\u00a0caused global warming to reach new highs. The big question is whether 2023 foretells more years in which heat records are not merely broken, but smashed.The reshaping of water flows cut off salmon from the mountain rivers where they cooled off in summer and from the floodplains, rich with bugs, where they packed on weight in winter. The loss of these and other habitats means the fish are less able to cope with the latest attack: climate change, primarily caused by burning fossil fuels.\nWhile recent rain and snow in California may help salmon rebound in three years, when the fish from this year\u2019s eggs are ready to be harvested in the ocean, the intensity of the flooding comes with downsides. Raging torrents can scour the riverbeds where salmon lay their eggs.People who rely on the fish are facing a painful reality.Keith Parker, senior fisheries biologist for the Yurok Tribe, whose members fish along the Klamath River in California, called the situation tragic. \u201cWe lost our language,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cWe lost our religion for a long time. We lost our fish. So, we lost a lot.\u201d When the fish are plentiful, Mr. Parker said, you can see a difference in people. \u201cOur community is much happier, it\u2019s healthier,\u201d he said. \u201cMental health is better.\u201dThe commercial salmon industry plans to request federal disaster relief. They don\u2019t just blame the drought; they blame the way water is allocated for agriculture.\u201cThere\u2019s been an ongoing war for years over water for salmon,\u201d said Glen Spain, executive director of the Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen\u2019s Associations. \u201cOur industry requires that water be left in the river. Big Ag has been trying to get the water out of the river into the fields.\u201dIt\u2019s an increasingly contentious issue in California politics.Many varieties of salmon are already listed as threatened or endangered in California, but a formidable hatchery effort in the Central Valley has kept fall-run Chinook, which return to California rivers in the autumn, strong enough for commercial and recreational fishing. But not this year.\nAlso known as king salmon, Chinook, with a high fat content and buttery taste, is generally the most valuable of Pacific salmon.\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad on two levels,\u201d said Sarah Bates, who fishes for salmon out of San Francisco. \u201cThe loss of income and loss of work is upsetting, but the deeper understanding of what\u2019s happening to our ecosystems and food resources is pretty devastating.\u201dCentral Valley hatcheries raise about 30 million fall-run Chinook a year, which can be largely protected from poor conditions in the rivers. In bad years, young salmon are loaded into trucks and driven to the sea. But even those fish are disappearing.Scientists worry that hatchery efforts are backfiring in part by weakening salmon\u2019s genetic resilience. Once in the ocean, the fish face another slew of threats that are less understood.\nOcean forces were found to be a major factor in the only other total shutdowns of salmon fishing in California, which happened in 2008 and 2009. The ocean off California has, at times, already gotten as hot as climate change models predicted it would be at the end of the century, said Steve Lindley, fisheries ecology division director for NOAA Southwest Fisheries Science Center. What saves salmon is an upwelling of nutrient-rich, cold water along the coast. But that upwelling was delayed in the mid-2000s, leaving the salmon with little food. They either starved or remained so small that they were picked off by seabirds, researchers found.Threats at sea are most likely playing a much smaller, but still notable, role in this year\u2019s dismal numbers, scientists say. One possible factor: Booming anchovy populations. In recent years, salmon have made anchovies a higher percentage of their diet. But anchovies contain an enzyme that breaks down thiamine, or vitamin B1, and salmon are becoming thiamine deficient. (Scientists connected the dots when baby fish started swimming upside down and dying. Infusing hatchery water with thiamine set them right.)What\u2019s becoming increasingly clear, according to scientists at NOAA Fisheries, is that the models used to predict stocks and manage fishing aren\u2019t working like they used to.\u201cWe keep getting surprised, even though we\u2019re trying to adjust expectations downward every year because of the previous surprises,\u201d Dr. Lindley said. That makes it harder to set fishing seasons and ensure fishers don\u2019t catch more than expected.To make matters worse, he said, an El Ni\u00f1o pattern is on the horizon, which could make the cold stream of water along the coast disappear. \u201cThis is what really scares some of us,\u201d Dr. Lindley said.\nGlobally, the ocean has absorbed more than 90 percent of the excess heat trapped on the planet by greenhouse gases.\nWhat gives Dr. Lindley and other scientists hope are efforts to fix the underlying causes of salmon declines rather than the symptoms.\nFossil fuel emissions must be addressed, scientists say. Meanwhile, restoring habitat lets salmon do what they\u2019ve evolved to do: Offset risk by spreading it out over space and time. Even within a salmon species, different populations return to different parts of different rivers at different times of the year. Think of it like diversifying risk across an investment portfolio, said Daniel Schindler, a professor at the University of Washington who studies watersheds and fish.\u201cThe best thing we can do is give those fish the best chance they have to figure it out evolutionarily,\u201d Dr. Schindler said, which means giving them as many habitat options as possible.So there was joy on the Klamath River last month as crews broke ground on a megaproject to remove four old hydroelectric dams, which will give salmon access to more than 400 miles of historic habitat, including so-called thermal refuges like cold springs.\u201cEven though it\u2019s like the lowest salmon runs and it\u2019s horrible, on the other side of the coin, it\u2019s also one of the greatest years because in July the first dam is coming down,\u201d said Mr. Parker of the Yurok tribe, which has been pushing for the project along with other tribes, the fishing industry and conservation groups.Another bright spot is efforts in which salmon advocates are working with farmers to find win-win solutions, such as turning rice fields into temporary floodplains in the winter, when rain is more plentiful, and growing salmon on them. Research has shown the young fish can grow 10 times as big that way, feasting on a bug buffet that simply doesn\u2019t exist in the faster-flowing rivers, which leaves them better equipped to survive their next stage of life in the ocean.\nAt the same time, the effort recharges groundwater and fertilizes the rice fields.Much of the water conflict in California, which is often framed as farmers versus fish, is actually the result of systems built long ago, when we knew far less about how rivers work, said Jacob Katz, a senior scientist with California Trout, a nonprofit group focused on restoring California\u2019s waterways.\u201cYou get this idea that it\u2019s an inevitable trade-off between agricultural production and wildlife production,\u201d Dr. Katz said. \u201cAnd what we see is that\u2019s not the case, that there is an incredible amount of middle ground.\u201d",

Monday\u2019s bounce came a day after Swiss authorities arranged a hasty takeover of the nation\u2019s embattled lender, Credit Suisse, by its rival, UBS. Major central banks also moved on Sunday to make dollar funding more readily available, and federal regulators announced an acquisition of parts of the collapsed Signature Bank in New York.Those efforts brought some relief to worried investors, even as they remained mindful that more turmoil could yet emerge. Already, analysts are concerned about the potential knock-on impact to the economy that could come as banks pull back from lending in order to insulate themselves from any further fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.The cautious tone on Monday also came a day before the Federal Reserve begins a crucial meeting. The Fed has been raising interest rates to rein in stubbornly higher inflation, but the volatility\u00a0in the banking sector has led to a complete reassessment of what the central bank will do next as investors worry about policymakers further turning the screws on an economy already showing signs of stress.\nTraders are evenly split on whether the central bank will raise interest rates at all when it announces a decision on Wednesday, a sharp change from just a few weeks ago, when many in markets expected the Fed to increase the rate\u00a0by half a percentage point\u00a0in response to hotter than expected inflation data.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Economists at Goldman Sachs said on Monday that they now expected the Fed to hold off raising rates this week \u201cbecause of stress in the banking system.\u201dThat stress was still evident in shares of some small banks. Notably, First Republic Bank, the target of a rescue attempt by larger rivals that injected billions in deposits into the lender\u00a0last week, slid nearly 50 percent on Monday. Its stock has dropped 90 percent this month, erasing tens of billions of dollars of market value and putting its future as an independent bank in doubt. First Republic\u2019s credit rating was downgraded by S&P Global on Sunday, for the second time in less than a week.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Another relatively small lender, Western Alliance, also tumbled. Its shares fell 6.7 percent after initially starting the day with a gain.In Zurich, Credit Suisse\u2019s share price slumped over 50 percent after its deal with UBS, which was agreed at a hefty discount to Credit Suisse\u2019s market value on Friday. Shares of\u00a0UBS gained more than 3 percent.\nSome American banks that have wavered after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank fared better on Monday. Shares of PacWest rose, as did Comerica and Zions Bank.Yet even as the volatile trading conditions in financial markets appeared to be easing, the fallout from the recent rout was still being felt by some investors.One strategy that has been particular hard hit by the recent turbulence is that of Commodity Trading Advisors. The strategy is employed by some of the largest investment funds in the world and follows the momentum of markets, buying as prices rise and selling as they fall. This makes these funds susceptible to sharp changes that can catch them off guard. An index of the 20 largest CTA managers run by Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale has fallen nearly 9 percent since the sell-off began.In debt markets, the Credit Suisse deal caused unease that some investors worried could linger because it upended the normal hierarchy in which investors\u00a0were paid back when a company faltered. Investors who own stock in a company are typically last in line to be paid when a company is wiped out. But in this case, owners of stock in Credit Suisse received one UBS share for every 22.48 shares they owned, according to the terms of the deal.In contrast, a special form of risky bank debt, known as AT1 bonds, were wiped out. On Monday, banking regulators and supervisors in the European Union, of which Switzerland is not a member, issued a statement reiterating that in their jurisdiction shareholders bear losses at banks before bondholders. The price of other European AT1 bank debt slid on Monday.\u201cI think it was a mistake to mess with the AT1s,\u201d\u00a0Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Academy Securities, said. \u201cThey have made everyone question this market.\u201dJason Karaian and Kevin Granville contributed reporting.",

	"text": "The new movie \u201cDumb Money\u201d dramatizes the true story of an unlikely messiah named Roaring Kitty who decides to sink his life savings into shares of the video-game seller GameStop and then praise the stock to his fans. So many people buy GameStop shares that the company\u2019s valuation soars, crushing the positions of professional hedge funds that had bet against it. Thus, a band of lovable misfits triumphs over the Wall Street fat cats.Much as we enjoyed the movie, we are economists, not movie critics. And as practitioners of the dismal science, we worry that some viewers will continue to be inspired to copy the heroes\u2019 investment strategies, which is about as smart as driving home at 100 miles per hour after seeing \u201cThe Fast and the Furious.\u201dYou can see our worry in the movie\u2019s title: \u201cDumb Money.\u201d That\u2019s Wall Street parlance for unsophisticated individual investors who make mistakes that can be exploited. Is it nice to call the actions of everyday Joe investors dumb? No. Is it fair? Well \u2026 yes.We aren\u2019t literally calling retail investors dumb. What we are saying is that retail investors are smart people who unfortunately behave in dumb, self-destructive ways. Their actions reflect overconfidence, financial ignorance and a wealth-reducing love of gambling. Even smart people like Sir Isaac Newton can make dumb investment decisions (he lost money in the South Sea bubble).\nAnd in celebrating an unintelligent investment strategy in a moment when the stock market was reaching historic heights of stupidity, \u201cDumb Money\u201d raises an important question: Are American financial markets getting dumber over time? Or was this just a momentary lapse?We did see a prior peak of stock market dumbness in the 1999-2000 tech stock bubble, when many retail investors made the mistake of being wildly overoptimistic about technology stocks. One of us, Owen Lamont, has even co-written (with Andrea Frazzini) an academic paper titled, you guessed it, \u201cDumb Money,\u201d describing self-destructive investor behavior during this period. But compared to the events of the GameStop story, that crazy optimism seems almost rational, since it at least involved a correct thesis (that the internet would eventually produce some profitable companies), however stupidly applied.After the tech bubble burst a year or so later, U.S. stock markets were less obviously dumb until the Covid-19 lockdowns spurred a tsunami of retail investing, as enormous numbers of people were suddenly stuck at home with nothing to do and, importantly, nothing to bet on. Casinos were closed and professional sports were on hold. Meanwhile, brokers like Robinhood were offering the option of trading stocks commission-free.The gambling impulse was also goosed by stimulus checks and social media platforms like Reddit and YouTube. Money flowed to \u201cmeme stocks,\u201d shares of oftentimes struggling companies that somehow caught the popular imagination owing to nostalgia or the desire to root for the underdog. This brings us to GameStop, a meme stock whose rise at the start of 2021 \u2014 despite the company\u2019s dismal business outlook \u2014 was really also an expression of populist anger. Ordinary Americans wanted to bet on the home team (an army of individual investors) against that other team (sinister billionaires betting against America).Since GameStop, a suspiciously high number of other dumb things have occurred recently. Just this year, we\u2019ve seen bizarre price fluctuations of meme stocks that are in or approaching bankruptcy and in foreign companies listing in the United States. One possible culprit for this wave of global dumbening is social media, which played a big role in GameStop by facilitating investor herding.\nShould we throw up our hands and conclude that the whole stock market is crazy? No. These crazy incidents still remain confined to only a few stocks. Stock prices usually revert to fundamental value, although it may take years. When this happens, retail investors who overpaid and held on too long get hurt.Retail investors have a well-established track record of destroying their own wealth. Studies have shown that individual traders somehow have the opposite of skill \u2014 they manage to do worse than they would by picking stocks at random.Why? Investing is hard, and there is a lot of competition. There are thousands of actively managed mutual funds. Do you think the average golfer would have a chance against Tiger Woods in his prime?The ineptitude of individual investors is not for lack of trying. In fact, the harder that individual investors try (in the sense of trading more often), the more they lose. For example, the professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean found that women investors did better than men. Why? Because men traded more. (They titled their paper \u201cBoys Will Be Boys.\u201d) So the conclusion from this finding is not (necessarily) that men are dumber. They are just more aggressively and overconfidently manifesting their dumbness. Perhaps this idea will resonate with some readers.The wealth-destroying powers of retail investors have been demonstrated many times: in stocks, mutual funds and options markets; in different countries and in different time periods. The evidence from Taiwan, which has excellent data on stock market trading, is particularly striking. Mr. Barber and Mr. Odean, together with their co-authors Yi-Tsung Lee and Yu-Jane Liu, have shown that individual investors underperform other investors by nearly 4 percent per year and that these losses are equivalent to about 2 percent of Taiwan\u2019s G.D.P.\nIf retail investors are the dumb money, who\u2019s the smart money? The answer includes skeptics who can spot a company\u2019s shortcomings and express their views by either selling their shares or betting that share prices will fall in a practice called short selling.Although \u201cDumb Money\u201d depicts professional hedge fund investors as heartless villains who treat a pet pig better than their housekeepers, it would be wrong for movie audiences to think that selling short is inherently bad. As we saw in the movie \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d which depicts a band of misfit short sellers spotting major problems in the U.S. financial system before its near collapse in 2008, these investors can also be lovable \u2014 even heroes. (Full disclosure: We may be biased about \u201cThe Big Short\u201d because one of us had a small part in the movie, while the other is jealous about that fact.)We certainly hope that over time, widespread meme stock investing will go the way of toilet paper hoarding and people will go back to rooting for the Red Sox versus the Yankees (or vice versa) instead of Roaring Kitty versus hedge funds. We hope that citizens concerned about inequality will express themselves in the voting booth, not in the stock market. And we hope that retail investors confine their gambling to small stakes, like buying lottery tickets or placing wagers on their favorite teams.Ask any finance professor and you\u2019ll get the same boring answer: The best way for most people to invest in the long term is to hold a diversified portfolio of stocks. Admittedly, a movie about a bunch of ordinary people gradually building wealth through prudent financial decisions would be the world\u2019s most boring movie. Boring, but also not dumb.\nOwen A.

	"text": "The stocks of U.S. regional banks plummeted on Monday, as investors reassessed how much such lenders were worth following the sudden collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.The volatile conditions led to trading in roughly a dozen banks being halted after triggering so-called circuit breakers, which are meant in part to prevent runaway crashes.Arizona-based Western Alliance stood out as the worst mover on the day, down 80 percent in early trading. First Republic Bank tumbled 75 percent, Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell around 20 percent, Comerica tumbled about 30 percent, East West Bancorp fell 30 percent and Regions Financial, headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., was down around 10 percent.Shares of bigger banks were less affected, but not immune. Citigroup and Wells Fargo fell over 4 percent, Bank of America fell over 3 percent, and JPMorgan Chase dipped by around 1 percent. The KBW bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 major banks, fell 10 percent, adding to sharp losses last week that erased nearly $200 billion from the aggregate value of the banks in the index.\nThe broader S&P 500 stock index shrugged off the worst of the pain in the banking sector, which is one of the smaller sectors of the index and therefore has less impact on the overall market. The S&P 500 rose slightly by late morning.The crisis in the banking sector also prompted a swift re-evaluation of the number of times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, as fears over the resilience of the economy are expected to stay the central bank\u2019s hand.That led to U.S. government debt markets experiencing their biggest moves since Black Monday in 1987, which was one of the most severe market crashes on record. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, fell 0.54 percentage points in morning trading, to just above 4 percent, its biggest one-day drop since October 1987.That might not sound like a lot, but the yield normally moves in tiny fractions of a percentage point each day, and only topped 5 percent last week for the first time since mid-2007. The move on Monday recalled the biggest moves around the fall of Lehman Brothers and the tech crash of the early 2000s.Having ramped up bets that the Fed would raise interest rates by as much as a full percentage point in the coming months, investors are now doubting whether the Fed would be that aggressive.\nThe Fed has used higher rates to slow the economy and lower inflation, which is also at the root of the pain being felt in the banking sector. Goldman Sachs said it believes the Fed would no longer raise interest rates at its meeting next week.Investors\u2019 expectations for where the Fed will set interest rates by June have fallen from 5.5 percent last week to 4.7 percent on Monday. In line with the slump in interest rates, the dollar fell 0.9 percent against a basket of currencies of America\u2019s major trading partners.",

	"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 On March 10, as fears were swirling over the health of the nation\u2019s banks, an investment account belonging to the children of Representative Jared Moskowitz, Democrat of Florida, sold shares of Seacoast Banking Corporation worth $65,000 to $150,000.Two days later, with the government working to control the crisis, Mr. Moskowitz said in a television interview that he had attended a bipartisan congressional briefing on the tumult. And on March 13, as investors fretted over the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and two other, smaller banks, Seacoast Banking shares fell nearly 20 percent.A spokesman for Mr. Moskowitz said in an email that the Seacoast share sales had been suggested by the congressman\u2019s financial adviser as a means to diversify his young children\u2019s holdings. Mr. Moskowitz said the congressional briefing on the bank crisis had taken place just before the television interview and after the shares were sold.But the transaction was just one example of how members of Congress continue to buy and sell stocks and other financial assets in industries that intersect with their official duties.\nAt least eight members of Congress or their close relatives sold shares of bank stocks in March, according to an analysis by Capitol Trades, a project of the data firm 2iQ \u2014 a number that could rise in the coming days, as lawmakers make additional disclosures of trades made last month.Though broadly legal, stock trading by members of Congress has become a flashpoint because lawmakers are sometimes privy to closely held information about the companies and industries they oversee.A New York Times investigation last year showed that during a three-year period, nearly a fifth of federal lawmakers or their immediate family members had bought or sold stocks or other securities that could have been affected by their legislative work.Efforts to pass legislation to place limits on trading by members of Congress or to ban it have stalled in recent years. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, announced a new bill intended to eliminate the practice that has 19 co-sponsors in the Senate.A House version of the bill is co-sponsored by Representative Michael Cloud, Republican of Texas, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois.\n\u201cAs the Silicon Valley Bank was closed, even during that period, there were reports that members of Congress were trading bank stocks,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI mean, imagine that \u2014 that members of Congress, we have more inside information,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cmembers of Congress are able, because of our jobs, to know more about the economy.\u201dRepresentative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, sold shares of First Republic Bank, the large depositor that was rapidly losing both cash and clients, on March 15, the day before it received an industry bailout of $30 million.The wife and children of Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, sold First Republic shares that same day. Representative John Curtis, Republican of Utah, sold shares in First Republic from a joint account with his spouse on March 16, the day the industry bailout occurred.By that time, First Republic shares had already fallen nearly 80 percent from a February peak. The timing of the sales by those three lawmakers or their relatives meant that the sellers averted an additional price swoon that was still to come. First Republic stock is now down nearly 90 percent since the beginning of this year.A spokesman for Mr. Goldman has said that his portfolio is managed by a third party without his knowledge and that he is setting up a blind trust to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Mr. Khanna has said that his filings relate to trades made by a diversified trust belonging to his wife and young children and that he has no involvement in it. Spokesmen for Mr. Curtis did not respond to requests for comment.\nSome members were also buying bank shares during the volatility. On March 17, Representative Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, bought shares of New York Community Bancorp after private discussions with New York State bank regulators. Her transaction was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Two days later, New York Community Bancorp bought assets belonging to the failed Signature Bank \u2014 a deal that prompted its biggest share rally ever. Around that same time, other lawmakers, including Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, and family members of Mr. Khanna, bought shares in larger U.S. banks, like Truist Financial. Mr. Goldman, among other transactions, made a series of purchases of shares in foreign banks, like Lloyds Banking Group and Mizuho Financial Group.A spokeswoman for Ms. Malliotakis said that her financial adviser had recommended the purchase and that it amounted to less than $5,000 in value. A spokesman for Mr. Peters did not respond to questions about the transaction.",

	"text": "The S&P 500, the index obsessed over by investors, executives and government officials, on Monday came close to finishing 20 percent above its lowest level of 2022, a gain that some on Wall Street see as the start of a bull market and a new phase of investing exuberance.The index fluctuated around the threshold on Monday, moving above it multiple times, before ending 0.2 percent lower for the day, which put it at 19.5 percent above its October low.Still, the move underscores the strong recovery in the stock market since fears of high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession had steadily pushed the index down from its peak in early 2022. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market \u2014 which is defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from an index\u2019s high \u2014 in June of that year, and continued to slide until hitting a low in October.The terms \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d are shorthand for excitement or fear among investors about the prospects for public companies. But while investors tend to agree on how to mark the start of a bear market, there\u2019s less consensus on how to define the start of a bull market, especially when the concerns that initially dragged stocks lower still linger.\nOne rule of thumb is that a new bull market is confirmed when an index sets a new high after rising from a bear-market low. By that measure, the S&P 500 is still more than 10 percent short.Inflation F.A.Q.Card 1 of 5What is inflation? Inflation is a general increase in prices, which will cause a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production\u00a0and supply chain problems.Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains\u00a0can lead to higher wages\u00a0and job growth.How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities\u00a0like food, housing and gas.Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid\u00a0inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.But some investors say it\u2019s simpler to look at any gain of 20 percent or more in a broad-based index like the S&P 500 as an important milestone, with the measurement taken at the end of the trading day. More than $15 trillion in investment assets are benchmarked or indexed to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index.\u201cWe\u2019re not in a horrible spot,\u201d said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cThere are recession risks for sure, but we have to see how those materialize over several months and into next year. So technically this is a bull market.\u201dStill, a rise of 20 percent from a low is, mathematically, less substantial than a fall of 20 percent from a high. Other investors prefer an assessment that involves a wider look at investor sentiment, economic growth and the market\u2019s direction.\u201cIf a stock goes from $10 to $5 and then rallies to $6, it\u2019s not in a new bull market,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \u201cDefining a bull or bear market, however it\u2019s done, should be done via a broad look at the market.\u201d\nThe recent rally in the S&P 500 has been led by a small group of tech stocks propelled by enthusiasm about the profit-generating possibilities of artificial intelligence, especially for those at the heart of its development and the production of hardware needed to power it. Nvidia, the chip maker, has come to symbolize this newfound enthusiasm for A.I. because its semiconductors are used in the technology. The company has rallied almost 170 percent this year \u2014 gains that have brought its valuation close to $1 trillion.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The average individual stock in the S&P 500 has risen less than 3 percent this year, market data through Friday\u2019s close shows, compared with a gain of over 11 percent for the index as a whole. Some 90 percent of the index\u2019s rise is due to bumper gains for just seven of the biggest companies: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.Apple rose 2.2 percent by early afternoon on Monday, briefly marking a new high for the company, before sliding to end 0.8 percent lower, weighing on the index.The S&P 500 also tracks only the largest companies listed in the United States. Smaller companies are generally more exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, because larger firms generate a sizable share of revenue overseas.The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, has recently recorded more modest gains than its big-company counterpart. The index fell over 30 percent from its peak in November 2021 to its low last June. Since then, the index has risen about 9 percent. On Monday, the index fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected economic data on the services sector.\nIn contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward big tech companies, has risen more than 26 percent this year alone. Yet it remains almost 20 percent below its previous peak, hit in late 2021.\u201cI think the 20 percent rule has been an easy one for folks to follow,\u201d said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cUnfortunately, some of these bear-market rallies are triggering that threshold, which we view as a false signal.\u201dFor many investors, the bumper returns in the stock market haven\u2019t been reflected in their portfolios\u2019 performance. That\u2019s because with so much concern about a possible recession, fund managers are largely holding more cash and hedging their holdings against the risk of a precipitous fall, forgoing gains in favor of greater safety.Just over 27 percent of funds tracked by Morningstar that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 are beating the index this year, compared with almost 52 percent last year and an average of 40 percent since 2000.Hedge funds and other leveraged investors especially have built up big bets on the S&P 500 falling, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u201cEveryone has been so defensive,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. \u201cThere is a lot of cash on the sidelines, and so this is actually quite painful for a lot of fund managers.\u201d",

	"text": "Markets fluctuated sharply on Friday after a fresh report on hiring pointed to a much stronger labor market than economists had expected, intensifying concerns among investors that the Federal Reserve would need to clamp down on the economy more forcefully to bring inflation under control, but also offering some comfort that any additional pressure would be set against a resilient backdrop.The Labor Department reported that employers added 336,000 jobs in September, far more than the 170,000 that economists had predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s a showstopping number,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life investments.The reaction on Wall Street was most evident in the $25 trillion market for U.S. Treasuries, where yields on government bonds had already been climbing sharply over the past couple of months. Persistently strong economic data has cemented an expectation that the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated for longer than previously thought to complete its aim of slowing inflation.On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a benchmark interest rate that underpins borrowing around the world, briefly shot up to 4.88 percent, its highest level since 2007, before easing back to 4.80 percent. In late July, that yield, indicative of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government, stood at 3.75 percent.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is a crucial input to virtually every other long-term interest rate in the world. Higher treasury yields indicate higher costs ahead for consumers and businesses, in turn weighing on company valuations in the stock market.The State of Jobs in the United StatesToo Few Workers: Employers in Vermont are battling a labor shortage as the local population grows older. The state\u2019s struggles offer an early look at where the rest of the country could be headed.Seasonal Hiring: After scrambling to fill out work forces the last few holiday seasons, many retailers are reporting more modest goals for temporary employment this year.Truck Drivers: The trucking industry has complained for years about a dire shortage of drivers. But some women say many companies have made it effectively impossible for them to get those jobs.A Surge in Start-ups: The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the U.S. economy in a lot of ways. But it might have also broken America out of a decades-long entrepreneurial slump.\u201cIf yields keep moving higher, they\u2019re going to create more restraint on the economy,\u201d said Drew Matus, the chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management.The dollar initially rose alongside higher rates, but ended the day 0.2 percent lower after the turn in the market.\nThe reaction in the stock market was also significant, traders said, exemplifying investors\u2019 sensitivity to interest rates, and also the hope that corporate America\u2019s resilience could continue even if policymakers are prompted to further restrict the economy.\nThe S&P 500 recovered from early losses to rally 1.2 percent for the day, rising as the yields on Treasuries eased. The rebound was enough to end a streak of weekly declines since the start of September.Companies more dependent on the outlook for the American economy initially suffered a more severe reaction among investors, but even there, trading reflected the recovery in the Treasury market as the day went on. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies rose on Friday but was lower for the week after turning negative for the year on Monday. The S&P 500 is still roughly 12 percent higher than it was at the start of 2023.Investors and analysts noted that the immediate market reaction would take time to settle, as rapid, automated trading, programmed to react to specific levels from data such as the jobs report, gave way to a broader group of investors entering the market.Given the data also extended a broader sell-off, investors had already dialed back their bullishness, analysts said, making for a softer change in sentiment reflected in the immediate price moves.Investors are also trying to make sense of conflicting signals for the long-term outlook of the economy.\nOn the one hand, the fresh jobs data points to a resilient economy, tempering immediate concerns about an economic downturn. However, a stronger-than-expected economy also suggests the Fed will need to do more to slow it down and get inflation under control. That could mean further headwinds for companies and consumers ahead, fanning fears that the Fed could go too far, tipping the economy into recession.Although the number of jobs added to the economy rose substantially, wage growth came in below economists\u2019 estimates. That adds to a narrative of a tougher time ahead for consumers, just as some consumer-facing companies gear up for the holiday sales season.\u201cThe economic narrative is one that is difficult for consumer incomes and corporate profits ahead,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said.The speed of the sell-off in the Treasury market is also \u201cworrying,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, raising concerns about the potential for the plumbing of financial markets to come under strain as swaths of investors try to reorient themselves after each additional piece of economic information. That fear has become especially acute after previous ructions in the Treasury market and in other government bond markets around the world.And there could still be further to go. Even before the fresh jobs data on Friday, some Fed policymakers had maintained a preference for further interest rate increases. Investors, however, are not so sure, maintaining only a low chance that the Fed raises rates again when it meets next month.\u201cI think the market may still be underpricing the risk the Fed hikes in November,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s that move that concerns me.\u201d",

	"text": "The collapse of a small bank in California on Friday set off a wave of concern over the health of the banking sector, amplifying fears for the broader economy and sending global stock markets lower.Silicon Valley Bank, a prominent bank for start-ups in Santa Clara, Calif., was put under the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation early Friday. The decision to close the bank followed whipsaw trading on Thursday that continued into Friday, after SVB said it needed to take immediate steps to shore up its finances amid a darkening environment for start-ups and other tech companies.Though it\u2019s a relatively small lender, SVB\u2019s failure overshadowed an upbeat report on the labor market, upended expectations for the path of interest rates and entrenched concerns about the health of the economy.The S&P 500 skidded 1.4 percent on Friday, ending the week down 4.5 percent \u2014 its worst week of the year. The decline was led by SVB\u2019s banking peers like Western Alliance Bancorp, which plunged over 20 percent, and Signature Bank in New York, which fell by almost 23 percent.\nThe KBW bank index, which tracks the stocks of 24 major banks, was also lower, and after falling each day of the week ended with a loss of more than 15 percent. The largest Wall Street banks held up better on Friday, with the concern focused on a handful of smaller institutions.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThis should be contained, but it would be excessively optimistic to think these issues won\u2019t weigh on investors\u2019 minds for some time,\u201d David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said. \u201cWe cannot know for certain how this will play out and the magnitude of the potential domino effect.\u201dTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday, said she was monitoring the situation. \u201cThere are recent developments that concern a few banks that I\u2019m monitoring very carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen banks experience financial losses, it is and should be a matter of concern.\u201dAhead of Friday\u2019s drop, the outlook on Wall Street had already turned gloomy after the Federal Reserve\u2019s chair, Jerome H. Powell, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the central bank might have to raise interest rates more than it expected, and possibly at a faster clip, as it tried to rein in inflation. Higher interest rates weigh on stock prices, and raise the risk the Fed\u2019s actions may tip the economy into a recession.Banks can be especially vulnerable to rising rates, which can cause the value of their investment assets to fall, as was the case with SVB. That can hurt their ability to raise money, especially when clients that are also struggling with the rising costs that come from higher rates are pulling their deposits out.\nFriday\u2019s jobs report for February assuaged those concerns somewhat. Investors homed in on slower wage growth and an increase in unemployment, in part because more people are coming back to the labor force, two data points that suggest the Fed\u2019s effort to slow the economy and rein in inflation may be working.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Some analysts said Friday\u2019s employment data would take the pressure off the Fed when it met this month, and bets in financial markets tilted back toward a smaller, quarter-point rate increase instead of a half-point raise, which had been favored earlier in the week.\u201cI think most would agree that won\u2019t happen,\u201d Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said of the possibility of a larger rate increase in March.However, others were less hopeful that the latest data on the jobs market would stay the Fed\u2019s hand. Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, said that beneath the headline numbers were signs that wages continued to rise for portions of the labor force and that robust hiring remained a cause for concern. The United States added over 300,000 new jobs in February, nearly 100,000 more than economists had predicted.\u201cIt\u2019s still a scorchingly hot pace of job creation,\u201d Mr. Temple said.Investors\u2019 split views point to the potential deciding influence of next week\u2019s reading on consumer price inflation for determining what the Fed is likely to do when it meets.\nThe yield on the two-year U.S. government bond, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, reflected the shifting narratives in financial markets. The yield rose above 5 percent on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2007 after Mr. Powell\u2019s comments as investors began to bet on higher interest rates to come.The move rapidly reversed course, however, as SVB\u2019s collapse created concerns about the effects of higher interest rates on the economy and the positive news on the labor market tempered the need for further increases. The yield on the two-year bond ended the week at 4.58 percent.\u201cInterest rate hikes are slowing the economy, and that is weighing on the U.S. economy,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments. \u201cWhat is happening to the banking sector is indicative of what investors fear could happen to other parts of the economy if interest rates continue to go up.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Investors flinched on Tuesday after the release of government data that upended the trend of falling inflation and signaled that the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to rein in rising prices is far from complete.After a day of choppy trading, as investors digested the data, the S&P 500 ended up roughly in line with where it had begun. U.S. government bond yields rose, reflecting expectations for higher interest rates as the Fed tries to bring inflation back under control.Investors had taken solace in recent months from a consistent slowing in inflation, helping to push the benchmark U.S. stock index up more than 6 percent in January. The prospect of a continued drop in the pace of price increases has recently lifted hopes that the Fed will soon stop raising interest rates, which have helped reduce inflation but have also raised costs for consumers and companies\u00a0by making it more expensive to get a mortgage or take out business loans, for example.Such exuberance had come under pressure in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 inching just 1.4 percent higher this month, ahead of the latest release of the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday. The data for January showed price increases accelerating\u00a0on a monthly basis, although the year-over-year numbers continued to show a slight easing.\n\u201cThis idea that we can get continued disinflation without a material slowdown in the economy has been the narrative the market has run with,\u201d said Priya Misra, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBut that has come under pressure, and today reinforced it.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Already, a robust jobs market, rising used-car prices and upward revisions to past inflation numbers had complicated the picture for investors.At the same time, policymakers have reignited expectations that the Fed will continue raising interest rates until the middle of the year, pushing up U.S. government bond yields and weighing on stock prices.The yield on the two-year Treasury bond nudged above 4.6 percent on Tuesday, its highest level of the year. The yield, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, had already risen roughly 0.25 percentage points this month ahead of the numbers \u2014 equal to the size of a typical rate increase from the central bank.And the persistent weakening of the U.S. dollar, when compared with a basket of currencies representing its major trading partners, had paused. On Tuesday, the dollar rallied back from earlier losses after the fresh inflation data came out but still ended the day 0.1 percent lower.\nBond investors had already begun to recalibrate their expectations for the number of interest rate increases to come from the Fed.At the start of February, futures markets, which allow investors to bet on the path of interest rates, suggested a consensus\u00a0view that the Fed would make\u00a0just one more quarter-point rate increase\u00a0when it met in March. That has since risen to decent odds that there will be\u00a0three increases of that size through July, which would take the Fed\u2019s target\u00a0rate to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, above the Fed\u2019s own forecasts published in December.It is a stark turnaround from the market\u2019s skepticism of the Fed\u2019s forecasts as recently as just a few weeks ago.\u201cIf you ask 10 people what they think inflation will do, you will get 12 opinions with cogent arguments back,\u201d said Jim Sarni, a managing director at the asset manager Payden & Rygel. He maintains that inflation may have peaked even if the pace of its moderation slows and there are occasional monthly \u201cblips.\u201dSuch mixed signals in the market this year reflect the uncertain outlook noted by Mr. Sarni. Inflation is falling and the economy remains robust, raising hopes among investors that a severe downturn will be avoided. Yet inflation remains high, and corners of the economy are proving resilient to the Fed\u2019s actions, raising the risk that the central bank will have to do even more to slow the economy \u2014 a point reiterated by some Fed policymakers in public comments on Tuesday.\u201cLast year, we had too much pessimism, but right now, we have a market that has got ahead of itself and is a little too optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sarni said. \u201cMarkets are vulnerable in the short run for that reason.\u201d",

	"text": "India\u2019s economy is booming. Stock prices are through the roof, among the best performing in the world. The government\u2019s investment in airports, bridges and roads, and clean-energy infrastructure is visible almost everywhere. India\u2019s total output, or gross domestic product, is expected to increase 6 percent this year \u2014 faster than the United States or China.But there\u2019s a hitch: Investment by Indian companies is not keeping pace. The money that companies put into the future of their businesses, for things like new machines and factories, is stagnant. As a fraction of India\u2019s economy, it is shrinking. And while money is flying into India\u2019s stock markets, long-term investment from overseas has been declining.Green and red lights are flashing at the same time. At some point soon, the government will need to reduce its extraordinary spending, which could weigh on the economy if private sector money doesn\u2019t pick up.\nNo one expects India to stop growing, but a rise of 6 percent is not enough to meet India\u2019s ambitions. Its population, now the world\u2019s biggest, is growing. Its government has set a national goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. That kind of leap will require sustained growth closer to 8 or 9 percent a year, most economists say.\nThe missing investment could also present a challenge for Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, who has concentrated on making India an easier place for foreign and Indian companies to do business.Mr. Modi is in campaign mode, facing elections in the spring and rallying the nation to cheer his successes. The sluggish investment is not something executives, bankers or foreign diplomats like to discuss, for fear of looking like naysayers. But investors are playing it safe while the economy is signaling both strengths and weaknesses.One point of widespread agreement is that India should benefit from China\u2019s slowdown, which has been fueled by an unfolding property crisis. China\u2019s geopolitical tensions with the West present another opening for India, by motivating foreign companies to move production in China to other countries.\nSriram Viswanathan, an Indian-born managing partner at Celesta, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund, describes investors \u201cwanting to fill the vacuum that has been created in the supply chain.\u201dMore on IndiaWhere\u2019s the Snow?:\u00a0Each winter, Gulmarg, one of Asia\u2019s largest and highest ski resort towns, attracts thousands of skiers. A snow dry spell has been devastating.Overburdened Courts: India\u2019s ever-deepening judicial backlog\u00a0is depriving citizens of their rights and hampering business activity. With 50 million criminal and civil cases pending, it would take 300 years to clear the country\u2019s docket.A Reversed Decision: India\u2019s top court restored life sentences for 11 Hindu men convicted of the gang rape of a Muslim woman\u00a0in a case that became a powerful symbol of the widespread violence against Indian women.Chasing China: India\u2019s economy is booming, but it\u2019s not growing fast enough to meet the government\u2019s goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. Here\u2019s why.\u201cThat, I think, is the opportunity for India,\u201d he said.The World Bank has applauded India\u2019s commitment to infrastructure spending, which ramped up during the pandemic when the private sector needed rescuing. Since then, the government has doubled down, paying for bricks-and-mortar improvement to the rickety roads, ports and power supply that once discouraged business investment.But the World Bank, whose mission is to nudge developing economies higher, says it is critical that those billions\u2019 worth of government spending ignite a burst of corporate spending. Its economists speak of a \u201ccrowd-in effect,\u201d which happens when, for instance, a new port next to a shiny new industrial park lures companies into building plants and hiring workers. Last year, the bank said it anticipated an imminent crowding-in, as it has forecast for almost three years running.\u201cTo accelerate the growth of confidence, public investment is not enough,\u201d Auguste Tano Kouam\u00e9, the World Bank\u2019s country director for India, said at a news conference in April. \u201cYou need deeper reforms to make the private sector invest.\u201d\nA lack of confidence helps explain why the stock markets are setting records, even while foreign investors are backing away from buying into the Indian economy through start-ups and acquisitions.\nThe stock markets in Mumbai, India\u2019s business capital, are worth nearly $4 trillion, up from $3 trillion a year ago, making them more valuable than Hong Kong\u2019s. India\u2019s small investors have been a big part of that, but trading stocks is quick and easy, compared with buying and selling companies. A recent annual average of $40 billion in foreign direct investment has shrunk to $13 billion in the past year.One reason that businesses are watching and waiting to make investments is Mr. Modi\u2019s powerful national government.On the one hand, business craves stability in political leadership, and India has rarely, if ever, had such a well-entrenched leader. He demolished the main opposition party in three big elections across the Hindi-speaking heartland in December and looks like a shoo-in for re-election this year. And Mr. Modi is vocally pro-business.\nHis government plays a markedly interventionist role in managing the economy, in a way that can make it dangerous for firms to place their stakes.In August, the government announced sudden restrictions on the import of laptop computers, to spur production at home. That sent businesses that depend on them into a tailspin, and the measure was almost as suddenly withdrawn. Likewise in July, the government slapped online betting companies with a retroactive 28 percent tax, gutting a $1.5 billion industry overnight.\nBusinesses close to Mr. Modi and his political circle have done especially well. The most prominent examples are Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries and the Adani Group, conglomerates that reach into numerous areas of Indian life. Their combined market power has grown gigantic in recent years: The flagship stocks of each company are worth about six times more than they were when Mr. Modi became prime minister.\nSome smaller companies have been the target of high-profile raids by tax-enforcement agencies.\u201cIf you\u2019re not the two A\u2019s\u201d \u2014 Adani or Ambani \u2014 it can be treacherous to navigate India\u2019s regulatory byways, said Arvind Subramanian, an economist at Brown University who served under Mr. Modi\u2019s government as chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018. \u201cDomestic investors feel a little bit vulnerable,\u201d he added.The past nine years of Modi government have improved many things in the business environment for all. Crucial systems work better, many types of corruption have been reined in and digitization of commerce has opened up new arenas for growth.\u201cWhat is really complex and interesting about this Modi phenomenon is that there\u2019s a lot of hype and bluster and manipulation,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said. \u201cBut it\u2019s built on a core of achievement.\u201dStill, foreign officials charged with bringing billions of investment capital to India complain that much of the traditional pain of doing business in India lingers. The one most frequently cited is red tape. Too many officials get involved at every level of approval, and it remains painfully slow to obtain legal judgments, let alone to enforce them.\nAnother factor holding back longer-term investment is an underlying weakness in \u201cthe India growth story.\u201d The most powerful source of demand, the kind that foreign investors and domestic businesses covet, is among the wealthiest consumers. In a population of 1.4 billion, about 20 million Indians are doing well enough to buy European consumer products, build luxury homes and beef up the top tier of the automotive sector.Most of the rest of the population is struggling with inflation in food and fuel prices. Banks are extending credit to consumers of both kinds, but less so to businesses, which fear that the great majority of their customers will be tightening their belts for years to come.\u201cFor the moment, there is no evidence that investors are feeling reassured about India,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said.But he remains hopeful. The annual growth, even if less than 6 percent, is nothing to sniff at. The new and improved infrastructure should attract more private investment eventually. And the benefits of consumer wealth, unevenly distributed as they are, could over time raise up more incomes.\nThe biggest wild card is whether India can grab a significant share of global business from China. The highest-profile example is Apple, the $3 trillion megacompany, which is slowly moving some of its supply chain away from China. Its pricey iPhone has barely 5 percent of the Indian market. But currently about 7 percent of the world\u2019s iPhones are made in India \u2014 and JPMorgan Chase has estimated that Apple intends to get that to 25 percent by 2025. At that point, all kinds of things become possible for India.\u201cWe should keep our minds open,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said.",

	"text": "The stocks of U.S. regional banks plummeted on Monday, as investors reassessed how much such lenders were worth following the sudden collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.The volatile conditions led to trading in roughly a dozen banks being halted after triggering so-called circuit breakers, which are meant in part to prevent runaway crashes.Arizona-based Western Alliance stood out as the worst mover on the day, down 80 percent in early trading. First Republic Bank tumbled 75 percent, Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell around 20 percent, Comerica tumbled about 30 percent, East West Bancorp fell 30 percent and Regions Financial, headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., was down around 10 percent.Shares of bigger banks were less affected, but not immune. Citigroup and Wells Fargo fell over 4 percent, Bank of America fell over 3 percent, and JPMorgan Chase dipped by around 1 percent. The KBW bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 major banks, fell 10 percent, adding to sharp losses last week that erased nearly $200 billion from the aggregate value of the banks in the index.\nThe broader S&P 500 stock index shrugged off the worst of the pain in the banking sector, which is one of the smaller sectors of the index and therefore has less impact on the overall market. The S&P 500 rose slightly by late morning.The crisis in the banking sector also prompted a swift re-evaluation of the number of times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, as fears over the resilience of the economy are expected to stay the central bank\u2019s hand.That led to U.S. government debt markets experiencing their biggest moves since Black Monday in 1987, which was one of the most severe market crashes on record. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, fell 0.54 percentage points in morning trading, to just above 4 percent, its biggest one-day drop since October 1987.That might not sound like a lot, but the yield normally moves in tiny fractions of a percentage point each day, and only topped 5 percent last week for the first time since mid-2007. The move on Monday recalled the biggest moves around the fall of Lehman Brothers and the tech crash of the early 2000s.Having ramped up bets that the Fed would raise interest rates by as much as a full percentage point in the coming months, investors are now doubting whether the Fed would be that aggressive.\nThe Fed has used higher rates to slow the economy and lower inflation, which is also at the root of the pain being felt in the banking sector. Goldman Sachs said it believes the Fed would no longer raise interest rates at its meeting next week.Investors\u2019 expectations for where the Fed will set interest rates by June have fallen from 5.5 percent last week to 4.7 percent on Monday. In line with the slump in interest rates, the dollar fell 0.9 percent against a basket of currencies of America\u2019s major trading partners.",

	"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 On March 10, as fears were swirling over the health of the nation\u2019s banks, an investment account belonging to the children of Representative Jared Moskowitz, Democrat of Florida, sold shares of Seacoast Banking Corporation worth $65,000 to $150,000.Two days later, with the government working to control the crisis, Mr. Moskowitz said in a television interview that he had attended a bipartisan congressional briefing on the tumult. And on March 13, as investors fretted over the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and two other, smaller banks, Seacoast Banking shares fell nearly 20 percent.A spokesman for Mr. Moskowitz said in an email that the Seacoast share sales had been suggested by the congressman\u2019s financial adviser as a means to diversify his young children\u2019s holdings. Mr. Moskowitz said the congressional briefing on the bank crisis had taken place just before the television interview and after the shares were sold.But the transaction was just one example of how members of Congress continue to buy and sell stocks and other financial assets in industries that intersect with their official duties.\nAt least eight members of Congress or their close relatives sold shares of bank stocks in March, according to an analysis by Capitol Trades, a project of the data firm 2iQ \u2014 a number that could rise in the coming days, as lawmakers make additional disclosures of trades made last month.Though broadly legal, stock trading by members of Congress has become a flashpoint because lawmakers are sometimes privy to closely held information about the companies and industries they oversee.A New York Times investigation last year showed that during a three-year period, nearly a fifth of federal lawmakers or their immediate family members had bought or sold stocks or other securities that could have been affected by their legislative work.Efforts to pass legislation to place limits on trading by members of Congress or to ban it have stalled in recent years. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, announced a new bill intended to eliminate the practice that has 19 co-sponsors in the Senate.A House version of the bill is co-sponsored by Representative Michael Cloud, Republican of Texas, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois.\n\u201cAs the Silicon Valley Bank was closed, even during that period, there were reports that members of Congress were trading bank stocks,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI mean, imagine that \u2014 that members of Congress, we have more inside information,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cmembers of Congress are able, because of our jobs, to know more about the economy.\u201dRepresentative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, sold shares of First Republic Bank, the large depositor that was rapidly losing both cash and clients, on March 15, the day before it received an industry bailout of $30 million.The wife and children of Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, sold First Republic shares that same day. Representative John Curtis, Republican of Utah, sold shares in First Republic from a joint account with his spouse on March 16, the day the industry bailout occurred.By that time, First Republic shares had already fallen nearly 80 percent from a February peak. The timing of the sales by those three lawmakers or their relatives meant that the sellers averted an additional price swoon that was still to come. First Republic stock is now down nearly 90 percent since the beginning of this year.A spokesman for Mr. Goldman has said that his portfolio is managed by a third party without his knowledge and that he is setting up a blind trust to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Mr. Khanna has said that his filings relate to trades made by a diversified trust belonging to his wife and young children and that he has no involvement in it. Spokesmen for Mr. Curtis did not respond to requests for comment.\nSome members were also buying bank shares during the volatility. On March 17, Representative Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, bought shares of New York Community Bancorp after private discussions with New York State bank regulators. Her transaction was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Two days later, New York Community Bancorp bought assets belonging to the failed Signature Bank \u2014 a deal that prompted its biggest share rally ever. Around that same time, other lawmakers, including Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, and family members of Mr. Khanna, bought shares in larger U.S. banks, like Truist Financial. Mr. Goldman, among other transactions, made a series of purchases of shares in foreign banks, like Lloyds Banking Group and Mizuho Financial Group.A spokeswoman for Ms. Malliotakis said that her financial adviser had recommended the purchase and that it amounted to less than $5,000 in value. A spokesman for Mr. Peters did not respond to questions about the transaction.",

	"text": "The S&P 500, the index obsessed over by investors, executives and government officials, on Monday came close to finishing 20 percent above its lowest level of 2022, a gain that some on Wall Street see as the start of a bull market and a new phase of investing exuberance.The index fluctuated around the threshold on Monday, moving above it multiple times, before ending 0.2 percent lower for the day, which put it at 19.5 percent above its October low.Still, the move underscores the strong recovery in the stock market since fears of high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession had steadily pushed the index down from its peak in early 2022. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market \u2014 which is defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from an index\u2019s high \u2014 in June of that year, and continued to slide until hitting a low in October.The terms \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d are shorthand for excitement or fear among investors about the prospects for public companies. But while investors tend to agree on how to mark the start of a bear market, there\u2019s less consensus on how to define the start of a bull market, especially when the concerns that initially dragged stocks lower still linger.\nOne rule of thumb is that a new bull market is confirmed when an index sets a new high after rising from a bear-market low. By that measure, the S&P 500 is still more than 10 percent short.Inflation F.A.Q.Card 1 of 5What is inflation? Inflation is a general increase in prices, which will cause a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production\u00a0and supply chain problems.Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains\u00a0can lead to higher wages\u00a0and job growth.How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities\u00a0like food, housing and gas.Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid\u00a0inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.But some investors say it\u2019s simpler to look at any gain of 20 percent or more in a broad-based index like the S&P 500 as an important milestone, with the measurement taken at the end of the trading day. More than $15 trillion in investment assets are benchmarked or indexed to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index.\u201cWe\u2019re not in a horrible spot,\u201d said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cThere are recession risks for sure, but we have to see how those materialize over several months and into next year. So technically this is a bull market.\u201dStill, a rise of 20 percent from a low is, mathematically, less substantial than a fall of 20 percent from a high. Other investors prefer an assessment that involves a wider look at investor sentiment, economic growth and the market\u2019s direction.\u201cIf a stock goes from $10 to $5 and then rallies to $6, it\u2019s not in a new bull market,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \u201cDefining a bull or bear market, however it\u2019s done, should be done via a broad look at the market.\u201d\nThe recent rally in the S&P 500 has been led by a small group of tech stocks propelled by enthusiasm about the profit-generating possibilities of artificial intelligence, especially for those at the heart of its development and the production of hardware needed to power it. Nvidia, the chip maker, has come to symbolize this newfound enthusiasm for A.I. because its semiconductors are used in the technology. The company has rallied almost 170 percent this year \u2014 gains that have brought its valuation close to $1 trillion.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The average individual stock in the S&P 500 has risen less than 3 percent this year, market data through Friday\u2019s close shows, compared with a gain of over 11 percent for the index as a whole. Some 90 percent of the index\u2019s rise is due to bumper gains for just seven of the biggest companies: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.Apple rose 2.2 percent by early afternoon on Monday, briefly marking a new high for the company, before sliding to end 0.8 percent lower, weighing on the index.The S&P 500 also tracks only the largest companies listed in the United States. Smaller companies are generally more exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, because larger firms generate a sizable share of revenue overseas.The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, has recently recorded more modest gains than its big-company counterpart. The index fell over 30 percent from its peak in November 2021 to its low last June. Since then, the index has risen about 9 percent. On Monday, the index fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected economic data on the services sector.\nIn contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward big tech companies, has risen more than 26 percent this year alone. Yet it remains almost 20 percent below its previous peak, hit in late 2021.\u201cI think the 20 percent rule has been an easy one for folks to follow,\u201d said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cUnfortunately, some of these bear-market rallies are triggering that threshold, which we view as a false signal.\u201dFor many investors, the bumper returns in the stock market haven\u2019t been reflected in their portfolios\u2019 performance. That\u2019s because with so much concern about a possible recession, fund managers are largely holding more cash and hedging their holdings against the risk of a precipitous fall, forgoing gains in favor of greater safety.Just over 27 percent of funds tracked by Morningstar that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 are beating the index this year, compared with almost 52 percent last year and an average of 40 percent since 2000.Hedge funds and other leveraged investors especially have built up big bets on the S&P 500 falling, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u201cEveryone has been so defensive,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. \u201cThere is a lot of cash on the sidelines, and so this is actually quite painful for a lot of fund managers.\u201d",

	"text": "Markets fluctuated sharply on Friday after a fresh report on hiring pointed to a much stronger labor market than economists had expected, intensifying concerns among investors that the Federal Reserve would need to clamp down on the economy more forcefully to bring inflation under control, but also offering some comfort that any additional pressure would be set against a resilient backdrop.The Labor Department reported that employers added 336,000 jobs in September, far more than the 170,000 that economists had predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s a showstopping number,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life investments.The reaction on Wall Street was most evident in the $25 trillion market for U.S. Treasuries, where yields on government bonds had already been climbing sharply over the past couple of months. Persistently strong economic data has cemented an expectation that the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated for longer than previously thought to complete its aim of slowing inflation.On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a benchmark interest rate that underpins borrowing around the world, briefly shot up to 4.88 percent, its highest level since 2007, before easing back to 4.80 percent. In late July, that yield, indicative of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government, stood at 3.75 percent.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is a crucial input to virtually every other long-term interest rate in the world. Higher treasury yields indicate higher costs ahead for consumers and businesses, in turn weighing on company valuations in the stock market.The State of Jobs in the United StatesToo Few Workers: Employers in Vermont are battling a labor shortage as the local population grows older. The state\u2019s struggles offer an early look at where the rest of the country could be headed.Seasonal Hiring: After scrambling to fill out work forces the last few holiday seasons, many retailers are reporting more modest goals for temporary employment this year.Truck Drivers: The trucking industry has complained for years about a dire shortage of drivers. But some women say many companies have made it effectively impossible for them to get those jobs.A Surge in Start-ups: The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the U.S. economy in a lot of ways. But it might have also broken America out of a decades-long entrepreneurial slump.\u201cIf yields keep moving higher, they\u2019re going to create more restraint on the economy,\u201d said Drew Matus, the chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management.The dollar initially rose alongside higher rates, but ended the day 0.2 percent lower after the turn in the market.\nThe reaction in the stock market was also significant, traders said, exemplifying investors\u2019 sensitivity to interest rates, and also the hope that corporate America\u2019s resilience could continue even if policymakers are prompted to further restrict the economy.\nThe S&P 500 recovered from early losses to rally 1.2 percent for the day, rising as the yields on Treasuries eased. The rebound was enough to end a streak of weekly declines since the start of September.Companies more dependent on the outlook for the American economy initially suffered a more severe reaction among investors, but even there, trading reflected the recovery in the Treasury market as the day went on. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies rose on Friday but was lower for the week after turning negative for the year on Monday. The S&P 500 is still roughly 12 percent higher than it was at the start of 2023.Investors and analysts noted that the immediate market reaction would take time to settle, as rapid, automated trading, programmed to react to specific levels from data such as the jobs report, gave way to a broader group of investors entering the market.Given the data also extended a broader sell-off, investors had already dialed back their bullishness, analysts said, making for a softer change in sentiment reflected in the immediate price moves.Investors are also trying to make sense of conflicting signals for the long-term outlook of the economy.\nOn the one hand, the fresh jobs data points to a resilient economy, tempering immediate concerns about an economic downturn. However, a stronger-than-expected economy also suggests the Fed will need to do more to slow it down and get inflation under control. That could mean further headwinds for companies and consumers ahead, fanning fears that the Fed could go too far, tipping the economy into recession.Although the number of jobs added to the economy rose substantially, wage growth came in below economists\u2019 estimates. That adds to a narrative of a tougher time ahead for consumers, just as some consumer-facing companies gear up for the holiday sales season.\u201cThe economic narrative is one that is difficult for consumer incomes and corporate profits ahead,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said.The speed of the sell-off in the Treasury market is also \u201cworrying,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, raising concerns about the potential for the plumbing of financial markets to come under strain as swaths of investors try to reorient themselves after each additional piece of economic information. That fear has become especially acute after previous ructions in the Treasury market and in other government bond markets around the world.And there could still be further to go. Even before the fresh jobs data on Friday, some Fed policymakers had maintained a preference for further interest rate increases. Investors, however, are not so sure, maintaining only a low chance that the Fed raises rates again when it meets next month.\u201cI think the market may still be underpricing the risk the Fed hikes in November,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s that move that concerns me.\u201d",

	"text": "The collapse of a small bank in California on Friday set off a wave of concern over the health of the banking sector, amplifying fears for the broader economy and sending global stock markets lower.Silicon Valley Bank, a prominent bank for start-ups in Santa Clara, Calif., was put under the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation early Friday. The decision to close the bank followed whipsaw trading on Thursday that continued into Friday, after SVB said it needed to take immediate steps to shore up its finances amid a darkening environment for start-ups and other tech companies.Though it\u2019s a relatively small lender, SVB\u2019s failure overshadowed an upbeat report on the labor market, upended expectations for the path of interest rates and entrenched concerns about the health of the economy.The S&P 500 skidded 1.4 percent on Friday, ending the week down 4.5 percent \u2014 its worst week of the year. The decline was led by SVB\u2019s banking peers like Western Alliance Bancorp, which plunged over 20 percent, and Signature Bank in New York, which fell by almost 23 percent.\nThe KBW bank index, which tracks the stocks of 24 major banks, was also lower, and after falling each day of the week ended with a loss of more than 15 percent. The largest Wall Street banks held up better on Friday, with the concern focused on a handful of smaller institutions.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThis should be contained, but it would be excessively optimistic to think these issues won\u2019t weigh on investors\u2019 minds for some time,\u201d David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said. \u201cWe cannot know for certain how this will play out and the magnitude of the potential domino effect.\u201dTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday, said she was monitoring the situation. \u201cThere are recent developments that concern a few banks that I\u2019m monitoring very carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen banks experience financial losses, it is and should be a matter of concern.\u201dAhead of Friday\u2019s drop, the outlook on Wall Street had already turned gloomy after the Federal Reserve\u2019s chair, Jerome H. Powell, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the central bank might have to raise interest rates more than it expected, and possibly at a faster clip, as it tried to rein in inflation. Higher interest rates weigh on stock prices, and raise the risk the Fed\u2019s actions may tip the economy into a recession.Banks can be especially vulnerable to rising rates, which can cause the value of their investment assets to fall, as was the case with SVB. That can hurt their ability to raise money, especially when clients that are also struggling with the rising costs that come from higher rates are pulling their deposits out.\nFriday\u2019s jobs report for February assuaged those concerns somewhat. Investors homed in on slower wage growth and an increase in unemployment, in part because more people are coming back to the labor force, two data points that suggest the Fed\u2019s effort to slow the economy and rein in inflation may be working.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Some analysts said Friday\u2019s employment data would take the pressure off the Fed when it met this month, and bets in financial markets tilted back toward a smaller, quarter-point rate increase instead of a half-point raise, which had been favored earlier in the week.\u201cI think most would agree that won\u2019t happen,\u201d Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said of the possibility of a larger rate increase in March.However, others were less hopeful that the latest data on the jobs market would stay the Fed\u2019s hand. Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, said that beneath the headline numbers were signs that wages continued to rise for portions of the labor force and that robust hiring remained a cause for concern. The United States added over 300,000 new jobs in February, nearly 100,000 more than economists had predicted.\u201cIt\u2019s still a scorchingly hot pace of job creation,\u201d Mr. Temple said.Investors\u2019 split views point to the potential deciding influence of next week\u2019s reading on consumer price inflation for determining what the Fed is likely to do when it meets.\nThe yield on the two-year U.S. government bond, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, reflected the shifting narratives in financial markets. The yield rose above 5 percent on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2007 after Mr. Powell\u2019s comments as investors began to bet on higher interest rates to come.The move rapidly reversed course, however, as SVB\u2019s collapse created concerns about the effects of higher interest rates on the economy and the positive news on the labor market tempered the need for further increases. The yield on the two-year bond ended the week at 4.58 percent.\u201cInterest rate hikes are slowing the economy, and that is weighing on the U.S. economy,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments. \u201cWhat is happening to the banking sector is indicative of what investors fear could happen to other parts of the economy if interest rates continue to go up.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Investors flinched on Tuesday after the release of government data that upended the trend of falling inflation and signaled that the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to rein in rising prices is far from complete.After a day of choppy trading, as investors digested the data, the S&P 500 ended up roughly in line with where it had begun. U.S. government bond yields rose, reflecting expectations for higher interest rates as the Fed tries to bring inflation back under control.Investors had taken solace in recent months from a consistent slowing in inflation, helping to push the benchmark U.S. stock index up more than 6 percent in January. The prospect of a continued drop in the pace of price increases has recently lifted hopes that the Fed will soon stop raising interest rates, which have helped reduce inflation but have also raised costs for consumers and companies\u00a0by making it more expensive to get a mortgage or take out business loans, for example.Such exuberance had come under pressure in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 inching just 1.4 percent higher this month, ahead of the latest release of the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday. The data for January showed price increases accelerating\u00a0on a monthly basis, although the year-over-year numbers continued to show a slight easing.\n\u201cThis idea that we can get continued disinflation without a material slowdown in the economy has been the narrative the market has run with,\u201d said Priya Misra, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBut that has come under pressure, and today reinforced it.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Already, a robust jobs market, rising used-car prices and upward revisions to past inflation numbers had complicated the picture for investors.At the same time, policymakers have reignited expectations that the Fed will continue raising interest rates until the middle of the year, pushing up U.S. government bond yields and weighing on stock prices.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The yield on the two-year Treasury bond nudged above 4.6 percent on Tuesday, its highest level of the year. The yield, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, had already risen roughly 0.25 percentage points this month ahead of the numbers \u2014 equal to the size of a typical rate increase from the central bank.And the persistent weakening of the U.S. dollar, when compared with a basket of currencies representing its major trading partners, had paused. On Tuesday, the dollar rallied back from earlier losses after the fresh inflation data came out but still ended the day 0.1 percent lower.\nBond investors had already begun to recalibrate their expectations for the number of interest rate increases to come from the Fed.At the start of February, futures markets, which allow investors to bet on the path of interest rates, suggested a consensus\u00a0view that the Fed would make\u00a0just one more quarter-point rate increase\u00a0when it met in March. That has since risen to decent odds that there will be\u00a0three increases of that size through July, which would take the Fed\u2019s target\u00a0rate to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, above the Fed\u2019s own forecasts published in December.It is a stark turnaround from the market\u2019s skepticism of the Fed\u2019s forecasts as recently as just a few weeks ago.\u201cIf you ask 10 people what they think inflation will do, you will get 12 opinions with cogent arguments back,\u201d said Jim Sarni, a managing director at the asset manager Payden & Rygel. He maintains that inflation may have peaked even if the pace of its moderation slows and there are occasional monthly \u201cblips.\u201dSuch mixed signals in the market this year reflect the uncertain outlook noted by Mr. Sarni. Inflation is falling and the economy remains robust, raising hopes among investors that a severe downturn will be avoided. Yet inflation remains high, and corners of the economy are proving resilient to the Fed\u2019s actions, raising the risk that the central bank will have to do even more to slow the economy \u2014 a point reiterated by some Fed policymakers in public comments on Tuesday.\u201cLast year, we had too much pessimism, but right now, we have a market that has got ahead of itself and is a little too optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sarni said. \u201cMarkets are vulnerable in the short run for that reason.\u201d",

India\u2019s total output, or gross domestic product, is expected to increase 6 percent this year \u2014 faster than the United States or China.But there\u2019s a hitch: Investment by Indian companies is not keeping pace. The money that companies put into the future of their businesses, for things like new machines and factories, is stagnant. As a fraction of India\u2019s economy, it is shrinking. And while money is flying into India\u2019s stock markets, long-term investment from overseas has been declining.Green and red lights are flashing at the same time. At some point soon, the government will need to reduce its extraordinary spending, which could weigh on the economy if private sector money doesn\u2019t pick up.\nNo one expects India to stop growing, but a rise of 6 percent is not enough to meet India\u2019s ambitions. Its population, now the world\u2019s biggest, is growing. Its government has set a national goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. That kind of leap will require sustained growth closer to 8 or 9 percent a year, most economists say.\nThe missing investment could also present a challenge for Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, who has concentrated on making India an easier place for foreign and Indian companies to do business.Mr. Modi is in campaign mode, facing elections in the spring and rallying the nation to cheer his successes. The sluggish investment is not something executives, bankers or foreign diplomats like to discuss, for fear of looking like naysayers. But investors are playing it safe while the economy is signaling both strengths and weaknesses.One point of widespread agreement is that India should benefit from China\u2019s slowdown, which has been fueled by an unfolding property crisis. China\u2019s geopolitical tensions with the West present another opening for India, by motivating foreign companies to move production in China to other countries.\nSriram Viswanathan, an Indian-born managing partner at Celesta, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund, describes investors \u201cwanting to fill the vacuum that has been created in the supply chain.\u201dMore on IndiaWhere\u2019s the Snow?:\u00a0Each winter, Gulmarg, one of Asia\u2019s largest and highest ski resort towns, attracts thousands of skiers. A snow dry spell has been devastating.Overburdened Courts: India\u2019s ever-deepening judicial backlog\u00a0is depriving citizens of their rights and hampering business activity. With 50 million criminal and civil cases pending, it would take 300 years to clear the country\u2019s docket.A Reversed Decision: India\u2019s top court restored life sentences for 11 Hindu men convicted of the gang rape of a Muslim woman\u00a0in a case that became a powerful symbol of the widespread violence against Indian women.Chasing China: India\u2019s economy is booming, but it\u2019s not growing fast enough to meet the government\u2019s goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. Here\u2019s why.\u201cThat, I think, is the opportunity for India,\u201d he said.The World Bank has applauded India\u2019s commitment to infrastructure spending, which ramped up during the pandemic when the private sector needed rescuing. Since then, the government has doubled down, paying for bricks-and-mortar improvement to the rickety roads, ports and power supply that once discouraged business investment.But the World Bank, whose mission is to nudge developing economies higher, says it is critical that those billions\u2019 worth of government spending ignite a burst of corporate spending. Its economists speak of a \u201ccrowd-in effect,\u201d which happens when, for instance, a new port next to a shiny new industrial park lures companies into building plants and hiring workers. Last year, the bank said it anticipated an imminent crowding-in, as it has forecast for almost three years running.\u201cTo accelerate the growth of confidence, public investment is not enough,\u201d Auguste Tano Kouam\u00e9, the World Bank\u2019s country director for India, said at a news conference in April. \u201cYou need deeper reforms to make the private sector invest.\u201d\nA lack of confidence helps explain why the stock markets are setting records, even while foreign investors are backing away from buying into the Indian economy through start-ups and acquisitions.\nThe stock markets in Mumbai, India\u2019s business capital, are worth nearly $4 trillion, up from $3 trillion a year ago, making them more valuable than Hong Kong\u2019s. India\u2019s small investors have been a big part of that, but trading stocks is quick and easy, compared with buying and selling companies. A recent annual average of $40 billion in foreign direct investment has shrunk to $13 billion in the past year.One reason that businesses are watching and waiting to make investments is Mr. Modi\u2019s powerful national government.On the one hand, business craves stability in political leadership, and India has rarely, if ever, had such a well-entrenched leader. He demolished the main opposition party in three big elections across the Hindi-speaking heartland in December and looks like a shoo-in for re-election this year. And Mr. Modi is vocally pro-business.\nHis government plays a markedly interventionist role in managing the economy, in a way that can make it dangerous for firms to place their stakes.In August, the government announced sudden restrictions on the import of laptop computers, to spur production at home. That sent businesses that depend on them into a tailspin, and the measure was almost as suddenly withdrawn. Likewise in July, the government slapped online betting companies with a retroactive 28 percent tax, gutting a $1.5 billion industry overnight.\nBusinesses close to Mr. Modi and his political circle have done especially well. The most prominent examples are Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries and the Adani Group, conglomerates that reach into numerous areas of Indian life. Their combined market power has grown gigantic in recent years: The flagship stocks of each company are worth about six times more than they were when Mr. Modi became prime minister.\nSome smaller companies have been the target of high-profile raids by tax-enforcement agencies.\u201cIf you\u2019re not the two A\u2019s\u201d \u2014 Adani or Ambani \u2014 it can be treacherous to navigate India\u2019s regulatory byways, said Arvind Subramanian, an economist at Brown University who served under Mr. Modi\u2019s government as chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018. \u201cDomestic investors feel a little bit vulnerable,\u201d he added.The past nine years of Modi government have improved many things in the business environment for all. Crucial systems work better, many types of corruption have been reined in and digitization of commerce has opened up new arenas for growth.\u201cWhat is really complex and interesting about this Modi phenomenon is that there\u2019s a lot of hype and bluster and manipulation,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said. \u201cBut it\u2019s built on a core of achievement.\u201dStill, foreign officials charged with bringing billions of investment capital to India complain that much of the traditional pain of doing business in India lingers. The one most frequently cited is red tape. Too many officials get involved at every level of approval, and it remains painfully slow to obtain legal judgments, let alone to enforce them.\nAnother factor holding back longer-term investment is an underlying weakness in \u201cthe India growth story.\u201d The most powerful source of demand, the kind that foreign investors and domestic businesses covet, is among the wealthiest consumers. In a population of 1.4 billion, about 20 million Indians are doing well enough to buy European consumer products, build luxury homes and beef up the top tier of the automotive sector.Most of the rest of the population is struggling with inflation in food and fuel prices. Banks are extending credit to consumers of both kinds, but less so to businesses, which fear that the great majority of their customers will be tightening their belts for years to come.\u201cFor the moment, there is no evidence that investors are feeling reassured about India,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said.But he remains hopeful. The annual growth, even if less than 6 percent, is nothing to sniff at. The new and improved infrastructure should attract more private investment eventually. And the benefits of consumer wealth, unevenly distributed as they are, could over time raise up more incomes.\nThe biggest wild card is whether India can grab a significant share of global business from China. The highest-profile example is Apple, the $3 trillion megacompany, which is slowly moving some of its supply chain away from China. Its pricey iPhone has barely 5 percent of the Indian market. But currently about 7 percent of the world\u2019s iPhones are made in India \u2014 and JPMorgan Chase has estimated that Apple intends to get that to 25 percent by 2025. At that point, all kinds of things become possible for India.\u201cWe should keep our minds open,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said.",

	"text": "The stocks of U.S. regional banks plummeted on Monday, as investors reassessed how much such lenders were worth following the sudden collapse of Signature Bank and Silicon Valley Bank.The volatile conditions led to trading in roughly a dozen banks being halted after triggering so-called circuit breakers, which are meant in part to prevent runaway crashes.Arizona-based Western Alliance stood out as the worst mover on the day, down 80 percent in early trading. First Republic Bank tumbled 75 percent, Utah-based Zions Bancorp fell around 20 percent, Comerica tumbled about 30 percent, East West Bancorp fell 30 percent and Regions Financial, headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., was down around 10 percent.Shares of bigger banks were less affected, but not immune. Citigroup and Wells Fargo fell over 4 percent, Bank of America fell over 3 percent, and JPMorgan Chase dipped by around 1 percent. The KBW bank index, which tracks the performance of 24 major banks, fell 10 percent, adding to sharp losses last week that erased nearly $200 billion from the aggregate value of the banks in the index.\nThe broader S&P 500 stock index shrugged off the worst of the pain in the banking sector, which is one of the smaller sectors of the index and therefore has less impact on the overall market. The S&P 500 rose slightly by late morning.The crisis in the banking sector also prompted a swift re-evaluation of the number of times the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates, as fears over the resilience of the economy are expected to stay the central bank\u2019s hand.That led to U.S. government debt markets experiencing their biggest moves since Black Monday in 1987, which was one of the most severe market crashes on record. The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, fell 0.54 percentage points in morning trading, to just above 4 percent, its biggest one-day drop since October 1987.That might not sound like a lot, but the yield normally moves in tiny fractions of a percentage point each day, and only topped 5 percent last week for the first time since mid-2007. The move on Monday recalled the biggest moves around the fall of Lehman Brothers and the tech crash of the early 2000s.Having ramped up bets that the Fed would raise interest rates by as much as a full percentage point in the coming months, investors are now doubting whether the Fed would be that aggressive.\nThe Fed has used higher rates to slow the economy and lower inflation, which is also at the root of the pain being felt in the banking sector. Goldman Sachs said it believes the Fed would no longer raise interest rates at its meeting next week.Investors\u2019 expectations for where the Fed will set interest rates by June have fallen from 5.5 percent last week to 4.7 percent on Monday. In line with the slump in interest rates, the dollar fell 0.9 percent against a basket of currencies of America\u2019s major trading partners.",

	"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 On March 10, as fears were swirling over the health of the nation\u2019s banks, an investment account belonging to the children of Representative Jared Moskowitz, Democrat of Florida, sold shares of Seacoast Banking Corporation worth $65,000 to $150,000.Two days later, with the government working to control the crisis, Mr. Moskowitz said in a television interview that he had attended a bipartisan congressional briefing on the tumult. And on March 13, as investors fretted over the failure of Silicon Valley Bank and two other, smaller banks, Seacoast Banking shares fell nearly 20 percent.A spokesman for Mr. Moskowitz said in an email that the Seacoast share sales had been suggested by the congressman\u2019s financial adviser as a means to diversify his young children\u2019s holdings. Mr. Moskowitz said the congressional briefing on the bank crisis had taken place just before the television interview and after the shares were sold.But the transaction was just one example of how members of Congress continue to buy and sell stocks and other financial assets in industries that intersect with their official duties.\nAt least eight members of Congress or their close relatives sold shares of bank stocks in March, according to an analysis by Capitol Trades, a project of the data firm 2iQ \u2014 a number that could rise in the coming days, as lawmakers make additional disclosures of trades made last month.Though broadly legal, stock trading by members of Congress has become a flashpoint because lawmakers are sometimes privy to closely held information about the companies and industries they oversee.A New York Times investigation last year showed that during a three-year period, nearly a fifth of federal lawmakers or their immediate family members had bought or sold stocks or other securities that could have been affected by their legislative work.Efforts to pass legislation to place limits on trading by members of Congress or to ban it have stalled in recent years. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, and Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, announced a new bill intended to eliminate the practice that has 19 co-sponsors in the Senate.A House version of the bill is co-sponsored by Representative Michael Cloud, Republican of Texas, and Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, Democrat of Illinois.\n\u201cAs the Silicon Valley Bank was closed, even during that period, there were reports that members of Congress were trading bank stocks,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cI mean, imagine that \u2014 that members of Congress, we have more inside information,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cmembers of Congress are able, because of our jobs, to know more about the economy.\u201dRepresentative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, sold shares of First Republic Bank, the large depositor that was rapidly losing both cash and clients, on March 15, the day before it received an industry bailout of $30 million.The wife and children of Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California, sold First Republic shares that same day. Representative John Curtis, Republican of Utah, sold shares in First Republic from a joint account with his spouse on March 16, the day the industry bailout occurred.By that time, First Republic shares had already fallen nearly 80 percent from a February peak. The timing of the sales by those three lawmakers or their relatives meant that the sellers averted an additional price swoon that was still to come. First Republic stock is now down nearly 90 percent since the beginning of this year.A spokesman for Mr. Goldman has said that his portfolio is managed by a third party without his knowledge and that he is setting up a blind trust to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Mr. Khanna has said that his filings relate to trades made by a diversified trust belonging to his wife and young children and that he has no involvement in it. Spokesmen for Mr. Curtis did not respond to requests for comment.\nSome members were also buying bank shares during the volatility. On March 17, Representative Nicole Malliotakis, Republican of New York, bought shares of New York Community Bancorp after private discussions with New York State bank regulators. Her transaction was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Two days later, New York Community Bancorp bought assets belonging to the failed Signature Bank \u2014 a deal that prompted its biggest share rally ever. Around that same time, other lawmakers, including Senator Gary Peters, Democrat of Michigan, and family members of Mr. Khanna, bought shares in larger U.S. banks, like Truist Financial. Mr. Goldman, among other transactions, made a series of purchases of shares in foreign banks, like Lloyds Banking Group and Mizuho Financial Group.A spokeswoman for Ms. Malliotakis said that her financial adviser had recommended the purchase and that it amounted to less than $5,000 in value. A spokesman for Mr. Peters did not respond to questions about the transaction.",

	"text": "The S&P 500, the index obsessed over by investors, executives and government officials, on Monday came close to finishing 20 percent above its lowest level of 2022, a gain that some on Wall Street see as the start of a bull market and a new phase of investing exuberance.The index fluctuated around the threshold on Monday, moving above it multiple times, before ending 0.2 percent lower for the day, which put it at 19.5 percent above its October low.Still, the move underscores the strong recovery in the stock market since fears of high inflation, rising interest rates and a looming recession had steadily pushed the index down from its peak in early 2022. The S&P 500 fell into a bear market \u2014 which is defined as a decline of 20 percent or more from an index\u2019s high \u2014 in June of that year, and continued to slide until hitting a low in October.The terms \u201cbull\u201d and \u201cbear\u201d are shorthand for excitement or fear among investors about the prospects for public companies. But while investors tend to agree on how to mark the start of a bear market, there\u2019s less consensus on how to define the start of a bull market, especially when the concerns that initially dragged stocks lower still linger.\nOne rule of thumb is that a new bull market is confirmed when an index sets a new high after rising from a bear-market low. By that measure, the S&P 500 is still more than 10 percent short.Inflation F.A.Q.Card 1 of 5What is inflation? Inflation is a general increase in prices, which will cause a loss of purchasing power over time, meaning your dollar will not go as far tomorrow as it did today. It is typically expressed as the annual change in prices for everyday goods and services such as food, furniture, apparel, transportation and toys.What causes inflation? It can be the result of rising consumer demand. But inflation can also rise and fall based on developments that have little to do with economic conditions, such as limited oil production\u00a0and supply chain problems.Is inflation bad? It depends on the circumstances. Fast price increases spell trouble, but moderate price gains\u00a0can lead to higher wages\u00a0and job growth.How does inflation affect the poor? Inflation can be especially hard to shoulder for poor households because they spend a bigger chunk of their budgets on necessities\u00a0like food, housing and gas.Can inflation affect the stock market? Rapid\u00a0inflation typically spells trouble for stocks. Financial assets in general have historically fared badly during inflation booms, while tangible assets like houses have held their value better.But some investors say it\u2019s simpler to look at any gain of 20 percent or more in a broad-based index like the S&P 500 as an important milestone, with the measurement taken at the end of the trading day. More than $15 trillion in investment assets are benchmarked or indexed to the S&P 500, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, which manages the index.\u201cWe\u2019re not in a horrible spot,\u201d said James Masserio, co-head of equities for the Americas at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \u201cThere are recession risks for sure, but we have to see how those materialize over several months and into next year. So technically this is a bull market.\u201dStill, a rise of 20 percent from a low is, mathematically, less substantial than a fall of 20 percent from a high. Other investors prefer an assessment that involves a wider look at investor sentiment, economic growth and the market\u2019s direction.\u201cIf a stock goes from $10 to $5 and then rallies to $6, it\u2019s not in a new bull market,\u201d said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Financial Group. \u201cDefining a bull or bear market, however it\u2019s done, should be done via a broad look at the market.\u201d\nThe recent rally in the S&P 500 has been led by a small group of tech stocks propelled by enthusiasm about the profit-generating possibilities of artificial intelligence, especially for those at the heart of its development and the production of hardware needed to power it. Nvidia, the chip maker, has come to symbolize this newfound enthusiasm for A.I. because its semiconductors are used in the technology. The company has rallied almost 170 percent this year \u2014 gains that have brought its valuation close to $1 trillion.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The average individual stock in the S&P 500 has risen less than 3 percent this year, market data through Friday\u2019s close shows, compared with a gain of over 11 percent for the index as a whole. Some 90 percent of the index\u2019s rise is due to bumper gains for just seven of the biggest companies: Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet, the parent company of Google.Apple rose 2.2 percent by early afternoon on Monday, briefly marking a new high for the company, before sliding to end 0.8 percent lower, weighing on the index.The S&P 500 also tracks only the largest companies listed in the United States. Smaller companies are generally more exposed to fluctuations in the U.S. economy, because larger firms generate a sizable share of revenue overseas.The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller public companies, has recently recorded more modest gains than its big-company counterpart. The index fell over 30 percent from its peak in November 2021 to its low last June. Since then, the index has risen about 9 percent. On Monday, the index fell 1.3 percent after weaker-than-expected economic data on the services sector.\nIn contrast, the Nasdaq Composite index, which is heavily weighted toward big tech companies, has risen more than 26 percent this year alone. Yet it remains almost 20 percent below its previous peak, hit in late 2021.\u201cI think the 20 percent rule has been an easy one for folks to follow,\u201d said Sameer Samana, a senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cUnfortunately, some of these bear-market rallies are triggering that threshold, which we view as a false signal.\u201dFor many investors, the bumper returns in the stock market haven\u2019t been reflected in their portfolios\u2019 performance. That\u2019s because with so much concern about a possible recession, fund managers are largely holding more cash and hedging their holdings against the risk of a precipitous fall, forgoing gains in favor of greater safety.Just over 27 percent of funds tracked by Morningstar that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 are beating the index this year, compared with almost 52 percent last year and an average of 40 percent since 2000.Hedge funds and other leveraged investors especially have built up big bets on the S&P 500 falling, according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\u201cEveryone has been so defensive,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. \u201cThere is a lot of cash on the sidelines, and so this is actually quite painful for a lot of fund managers.\u201d",

	"text": "Markets fluctuated sharply on Friday after a fresh report on hiring pointed to a much stronger labor market than economists had expected, intensifying concerns among investors that the Federal Reserve would need to clamp down on the economy more forcefully to bring inflation under control, but also offering some comfort that any additional pressure would be set against a resilient backdrop.The Labor Department reported that employers added 336,000 jobs in September, far more than the 170,000 that economists had predicted. \u201cIt\u2019s a showstopping number,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life investments.The reaction on Wall Street was most evident in the $25 trillion market for U.S. Treasuries, where yields on government bonds had already been climbing sharply over the past couple of months. Persistently strong economic data has cemented an expectation that the Fed will need to keep interest rates elevated for longer than previously thought to complete its aim of slowing inflation.On Friday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a benchmark interest rate that underpins borrowing around the world, briefly shot up to 4.88 percent, its highest level since 2007, before easing back to 4.80 percent. In late July, that yield, indicative of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government, stood at 3.75 percent.\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury bond is a crucial input to virtually every other long-term interest rate in the world. Higher treasury yields indicate higher costs ahead for consumers and businesses, in turn weighing on company valuations in the stock market.The State of Jobs in the United StatesToo Few Workers: Employers in Vermont are battling a labor shortage as the local population grows older. The state\u2019s struggles offer an early look at where the rest of the country could be headed.Seasonal Hiring: After scrambling to fill out work forces the last few holiday seasons, many retailers are reporting more modest goals for temporary employment this year.Truck Drivers: The trucking industry has complained for years about a dire shortage of drivers. But some women say many companies have made it effectively impossible for them to get those jobs.A Surge in Start-ups: The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the U.S. economy in a lot of ways. But it might have also broken America out of a decades-long entrepreneurial slump.\u201cIf yields keep moving higher, they\u2019re going to create more restraint on the economy,\u201d said Drew Matus, the chief market strategist at MetLife Investment Management.The dollar initially rose alongside higher rates, but ended the day 0.2 percent lower after the turn in the market.\nThe reaction in the stock market was also significant, traders said, exemplifying investors\u2019 sensitivity to interest rates, and also the hope that corporate America\u2019s resilience could continue even if policymakers are prompted to further restrict the economy.\nThe S&P 500 recovered from early losses to rally 1.2 percent for the day, rising as the yields on Treasuries eased. The rebound was enough to end a streak of weekly declines since the start of September.Companies more dependent on the outlook for the American economy initially suffered a more severe reaction among investors, but even there, trading reflected the recovery in the Treasury market as the day went on. The Russell 2000 Index of smaller companies rose on Friday but was lower for the week after turning negative for the year on Monday. The S&P 500 is still roughly 12 percent higher than it was at the start of 2023.Investors and analysts noted that the immediate market reaction would take time to settle, as rapid, automated trading, programmed to react to specific levels from data such as the jobs report, gave way to a broader group of investors entering the market.Given the data also extended a broader sell-off, investors had already dialed back their bullishness, analysts said, making for a softer change in sentiment reflected in the immediate price moves.Investors are also trying to make sense of conflicting signals for the long-term outlook of the economy.\nOn the one hand, the fresh jobs data points to a resilient economy, tempering immediate concerns about an economic downturn. However, a stronger-than-expected economy also suggests the Fed will need to do more to slow it down and get inflation under control. That could mean further headwinds for companies and consumers ahead, fanning fears that the Fed could go too far, tipping the economy into recession.Although the number of jobs added to the economy rose substantially, wage growth came in below economists\u2019 estimates. That adds to a narrative of a tougher time ahead for consumers, just as some consumer-facing companies gear up for the holiday sales season.\u201cThe economic narrative is one that is difficult for consumer incomes and corporate profits ahead,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said.The speed of the sell-off in the Treasury market is also \u201cworrying,\u201d said Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, raising concerns about the potential for the plumbing of financial markets to come under strain as swaths of investors try to reorient themselves after each additional piece of economic information. That fear has become especially acute after previous ructions in the Treasury market and in other government bond markets around the world.And there could still be further to go. Even before the fresh jobs data on Friday, some Fed policymakers had maintained a preference for further interest rate increases. Investors, however, are not so sure, maintaining only a low chance that the Fed raises rates again when it meets next month.\u201cI think the market may still be underpricing the risk the Fed hikes in November,\u201d Ms. Goodwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s that move that concerns me.\u201d",

	"text": "The collapse of a small bank in California on Friday set off a wave of concern over the health of the banking sector, amplifying fears for the broader economy and sending global stock markets lower.Silicon Valley Bank, a prominent bank for start-ups in Santa Clara, Calif., was put under the control of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation early Friday. The decision to close the bank followed whipsaw trading on Thursday that continued into Friday, after SVB said it needed to take immediate steps to shore up its finances amid a darkening environment for start-ups and other tech companies.Though it\u2019s a relatively small lender, SVB\u2019s failure overshadowed an upbeat report on the labor market, upended expectations for the path of interest rates and entrenched concerns about the health of the economy.The S&P 500 skidded 1.4 percent on Friday, ending the week down 4.5 percent \u2014 its worst week of the year. The decline was led by SVB\u2019s banking peers like Western Alliance Bancorp, which plunged over 20 percent, and Signature Bank in New York, which fell by almost 23 percent.\nThe KBW bank index, which tracks the stocks of 24 major banks, was also lower, and after falling each day of the week ended with a loss of more than 15 percent. The largest Wall Street banks held up better on Friday, with the concern focused on a handful of smaller institutions.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThis should be contained, but it would be excessively optimistic to think these issues won\u2019t weigh on investors\u2019 minds for some time,\u201d David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors, said. \u201cWe cannot know for certain how this will play out and the magnitude of the potential domino effect.\u201dTreasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee on Friday, said she was monitoring the situation. \u201cThere are recent developments that concern a few banks that I\u2019m monitoring very carefully,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen banks experience financial losses, it is and should be a matter of concern.\u201dAhead of Friday\u2019s drop, the outlook on Wall Street had already turned gloomy after the Federal Reserve\u2019s chair, Jerome H. Powell, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the central bank might have to raise interest rates more than it expected, and possibly at a faster clip, as it tried to rein in inflation. Higher interest rates weigh on stock prices, and raise the risk the Fed\u2019s actions may tip the economy into a recession.Banks can be especially vulnerable to rising rates, which can cause the value of their investment assets to fall, as was the case with SVB. That can hurt their ability to raise money, especially when clients that are also struggling with the rising costs that come from higher rates are pulling their deposits out.\nFriday\u2019s jobs report for February assuaged those concerns somewhat. Investors homed in on slower wage growth and an increase in unemployment, in part because more people are coming back to the labor force, two data points that suggest the Fed\u2019s effort to slow the economy and rein in inflation may be working.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Some analysts said Friday\u2019s employment data would take the pressure off the Fed when it met this month, and bets in financial markets tilted back toward a smaller, quarter-point rate increase instead of a half-point raise, which had been favored earlier in the week.\u201cI think most would agree that won\u2019t happen,\u201d Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco, said of the possibility of a larger rate increase in March.However, others were less hopeful that the latest data on the jobs market would stay the Fed\u2019s hand. Ron Temple, chief market strategist at Lazard, said that beneath the headline numbers were signs that wages continued to rise for portions of the labor force and that robust hiring remained a cause for concern. The United States added over 300,000 new jobs in February, nearly 100,000 more than economists had predicted.\u201cIt\u2019s still a scorchingly hot pace of job creation,\u201d Mr. Temple said.Investors\u2019 split views point to the potential deciding influence of next week\u2019s reading on consumer price inflation for determining what the Fed is likely to do when it meets.\nThe yield on the two-year U.S. government bond, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, reflected the shifting narratives in financial markets. The yield rose above 5 percent on Tuesday for the first time since mid-2007 after Mr. Powell\u2019s comments as investors began to bet on higher interest rates to come.The move rapidly reversed course, however, as SVB\u2019s collapse created concerns about the effects of higher interest rates on the economy and the positive news on the labor market tempered the need for further increases. The yield on the two-year bond ended the week at 4.58 percent.\u201cInterest rate hikes are slowing the economy, and that is weighing on the U.S. economy,\u201d said Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments. \u201cWhat is happening to the banking sector is indicative of what investors fear could happen to other parts of the economy if interest rates continue to go up.\u201dAlan Rappeport contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Investors flinched on Tuesday after the release of government data that upended the trend of falling inflation and signaled that the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to rein in rising prices is far from complete.After a day of choppy trading, as investors digested the data, the S&P 500 ended up roughly in line with where it had begun. U.S. government bond yields rose, reflecting expectations for higher interest rates as the Fed tries to bring inflation back under control.Investors had taken solace in recent months from a consistent slowing in inflation, helping to push the benchmark U.S. stock index up more than 6 percent in January. The prospect of a continued drop in the pace of price increases has recently lifted hopes that the Fed will soon stop raising interest rates, which have helped reduce inflation but have also raised costs for consumers and companies\u00a0by making it more expensive to get a mortgage or take out business loans, for example.Such exuberance had come under pressure in recent weeks, with the S&P 500 inching just 1.4 percent higher this month, ahead of the latest release of the Consumer Price Index on Tuesday. The data for January showed price increases accelerating\u00a0on a monthly basis, although the year-over-year numbers continued to show a slight easing.\n\u201cThis idea that we can get continued disinflation without a material slowdown in the economy has been the narrative the market has run with,\u201d said Priya Misra, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities. \u201cBut that has come under pressure, and today reinforced it.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Already, a robust jobs market, rising used-car prices and upward revisions to past inflation numbers had complicated the picture for investors.At the same time, policymakers have reignited expectations that the Fed will continue raising interest rates until the middle of the year, pushing up U.S. government bond yields and weighing on stock prices.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.The yield on the two-year Treasury bond nudged above 4.6 percent on Tuesday, its highest level of the year. The yield, which is sensitive to changes in Fed policy, had already risen roughly 0.25 percentage points this month ahead of the numbers \u2014 equal to the size of a typical rate increase from the central bank.And the persistent weakening of the U.S. dollar, when compared with a basket of currencies representing its major trading partners, had paused. On Tuesday, the dollar rallied back from earlier losses after the fresh inflation data came out but still ended the day 0.1 percent lower.\nBond investors had already begun to recalibrate their expectations for the number of interest rate increases to come from the Fed.At the start of February, futures markets, which allow investors to bet on the path of interest rates, suggested a consensus\u00a0view that the Fed would make\u00a0just one more quarter-point rate increase\u00a0when it met in March. That has since risen to decent odds that there will be\u00a0three increases of that size through July, which would take the Fed\u2019s target\u00a0rate to a range of 5.25 to 5.5 percent, above the Fed\u2019s own forecasts published in December.It is a stark turnaround from the market\u2019s skepticism of the Fed\u2019s forecasts as recently as just a few weeks ago.\u201cIf you ask 10 people what they think inflation will do, you will get 12 opinions with cogent arguments back,\u201d said Jim Sarni, a managing director at the asset manager Payden & Rygel. He maintains that inflation may have peaked even if the pace of its moderation slows and there are occasional monthly \u201cblips.\u201dSuch mixed signals in the market this year reflect the uncertain outlook noted by Mr. Sarni. Inflation is falling and the economy remains robust, raising hopes among investors that a severe downturn will be avoided. Yet inflation remains high, and corners of the economy are proving resilient to the Fed\u2019s actions, raising the risk that the central bank will have to do even more to slow the economy \u2014 a point reiterated by some Fed policymakers in public comments on Tuesday.\u201cLast year, we had too much pessimism, but right now, we have a market that has got ahead of itself and is a little too optimistic,\u201d Mr. Sarni said. \u201cMarkets are vulnerable in the short run for that reason.\u201d",

	"text": "India\u2019s economy is booming. Stock prices are through the roof, among the best performing in the world. The government\u2019s investment in airports, bridges and roads, and clean-energy infrastructure is visible almost everywhere. India\u2019s total output, or gross domestic product, is expected to increase 6 percent this year \u2014 faster than the United States or China.But there\u2019s a hitch: Investment by Indian companies is not keeping pace. The money that companies put into the future of their businesses, for things like new machines and factories, is stagnant. As a fraction of India\u2019s economy, it is shrinking. And while money is flying into India\u2019s stock markets, long-term investment from overseas has been declining.Green and red lights are flashing at the same time. At some point soon, the government will need to reduce its extraordinary spending, which could weigh on the economy if private sector money doesn\u2019t pick up.\nNo one expects India to stop growing, but a rise of 6 percent is not enough to meet India\u2019s ambitions. Its population, now the world\u2019s biggest, is growing. Its government has set a national goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. That kind of leap will require sustained growth closer to 8 or 9 percent a year, most economists say.\nThe missing investment could also present a challenge for Narendra Modi, the prime minister since 2014, who has concentrated on making India an easier place for foreign and Indian companies to do business.Mr. Modi is in campaign mode, facing elections in the spring and rallying the nation to cheer his successes. The sluggish investment is not something executives, bankers or foreign diplomats like to discuss, for fear of looking like naysayers. But investors are playing it safe while the economy is signaling both strengths and weaknesses.One point of widespread agreement is that India should benefit from China\u2019s slowdown, which has been fueled by an unfolding property crisis. China\u2019s geopolitical tensions with the West present another opening for India, by motivating foreign companies to move production in China to other countries.\nSriram Viswanathan, an Indian-born managing partner at Celesta, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund, describes investors \u201cwanting to fill the vacuum that has been created in the supply chain.\u201dMore on IndiaWhere\u2019s the Snow?:\u00a0Each winter, Gulmarg, one of Asia\u2019s largest and highest ski resort towns, attracts thousands of skiers. A snow dry spell has been devastating.Overburdened Courts: India\u2019s ever-deepening judicial backlog\u00a0is depriving citizens of their rights and hampering business activity. With 50 million criminal and civil cases pending, it would take 300 years to clear the country\u2019s docket.A Reversed Decision: India\u2019s top court restored life sentences for 11 Hindu men convicted of the gang rape of a Muslim woman\u00a0in a case that became a powerful symbol of the widespread violence against Indian women.Chasing China: India\u2019s economy is booming, but it\u2019s not growing fast enough to meet the government\u2019s goal of catching up to China and becoming a developed nation by 2047. Here\u2019s why.\u201cThat, I think, is the opportunity for India,\u201d he said.The World Bank has applauded India\u2019s commitment to infrastructure spending, which ramped up during the pandemic when the private sector needed rescuing. Since then, the government has doubled down, paying for bricks-and-mortar improvement to the rickety roads, ports and power supply that once discouraged business investment.But the World Bank, whose mission is to nudge developing economies higher, says it is critical that those billions\u2019 worth of government spending ignite a burst of corporate spending. Its economists speak of a \u201ccrowd-in effect,\u201d which happens when, for instance, a new port next to a shiny new industrial park lures companies into building plants and hiring workers. Last year, the bank said it anticipated an imminent crowding-in, as it has forecast for almost three years running.\u201cTo accelerate the growth of confidence, public investment is not enough,\u201d Auguste Tano Kouam\u00e9, the World Bank\u2019s country director for India, said at a news conference in April. \u201cYou need deeper reforms to make the private sector invest.\u201d\nA lack of confidence helps explain why the stock markets are setting records, even while foreign investors are backing away from buying into the Indian economy through start-ups and acquisitions.\nThe stock markets in Mumbai, India\u2019s business capital, are worth nearly $4 trillion, up from $3 trillion a year ago, making them more valuable than Hong Kong\u2019s. India\u2019s small investors have been a big part of that, but trading stocks is quick and easy, compared with buying and selling companies. A recent annual average of $40 billion in foreign direct investment has shrunk to $13 billion in the past year.One reason that businesses are watching and waiting to make investments is Mr. Modi\u2019s powerful national government.On the one hand, business craves stability in political leadership, and India has rarely, if ever, had such a well-entrenched leader. He demolished the main opposition party in three big elections across the Hindi-speaking heartland in December and looks like a shoo-in for re-election this year. And Mr. Modi is vocally pro-business.\nHis government plays a markedly interventionist role in managing the economy, in a way that can make it dangerous for firms to place their stakes.In August, the government announced sudden restrictions on the import of laptop computers, to spur production at home. That sent businesses that depend on them into a tailspin, and the measure was almost as suddenly withdrawn. Likewise in July, the government slapped online betting companies with a retroactive 28 percent tax, gutting a $1.5 billion industry overnight.\nBusinesses close to Mr. Modi and his political circle have done especially well. The most prominent examples are Mukesh Ambani\u2019s Reliance Industries and the Adani Group, conglomerates that reach into numerous areas of Indian life. Their combined market power has grown gigantic in recent years: The flagship stocks of each company are worth about six times more than they were when Mr. Modi became prime minister.\nSome smaller companies have been the target of high-profile raids by tax-enforcement agencies.\u201cIf you\u2019re not the two A\u2019s\u201d \u2014 Adani or Ambani \u2014 it can be treacherous to navigate India\u2019s regulatory byways, said Arvind Subramanian, an economist at Brown University who served under Mr. Modi\u2019s government as chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018. \u201cDomestic investors feel a little bit vulnerable,\u201d he added.The past nine years of Modi government have improved many things in the business environment for all. Crucial systems work better, many types of corruption have been reined in and digitization of commerce has opened up new arenas for growth.\u201cWhat is really complex and interesting about this Modi phenomenon is that there\u2019s a lot of hype and bluster and manipulation,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said. \u201cBut it\u2019s built on a core of achievement.\u201dStill, foreign officials charged with bringing billions of investment capital to India complain that much of the traditional pain of doing business in India lingers. The one most frequently cited is red tape. Too many officials get involved at every level of approval, and it remains painfully slow to obtain legal judgments, let alone to enforce them.\nAnother factor holding back longer-term investment is an underlying weakness in \u201cthe India growth story.\u201d The most powerful source of demand, the kind that foreign investors and domestic businesses covet, is among the wealthiest consumers. In a population of 1.4 billion, about 20 million Indians are doing well enough to buy European consumer products, build luxury homes and beef up the top tier of the automotive sector.Most of the rest of the population is struggling with inflation in food and fuel prices. Banks are extending credit to consumers of both kinds, but less so to businesses, which fear that the great majority of their customers will be tightening their belts for years to come.\u201cFor the moment, there is no evidence that investors are feeling reassured about India,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said.But he remains hopeful. The annual growth, even if less than 6 percent, is nothing to sniff at. The new and improved infrastructure should attract more private investment eventually. And the benefits of consumer wealth, unevenly distributed as they are, could over time raise up more incomes.\nThe biggest wild card is whether India can grab a significant share of global business from China. The highest-profile example is Apple, the $3 trillion megacompany, which is slowly moving some of its supply chain away from China. Its pricey iPhone has barely 5 percent of the Indian market. But currently about 7 percent of the world\u2019s iPhones are made in India \u2014 and JPMorgan Chase has estimated that Apple intends to get that to 25 percent by 2025. At that point, all kinds of things become possible for India.\u201cWe should keep our minds open,\u201d Mr. Subramanian said.",

	"text": "A group of regional bank stocks that came under severe pressure this week, stoking fears of a spiraling banking crisis, surged on Friday, at least partly alleviating those worries.The rebound came as the market was also bolstered by data on hiring that was deemed strong enough to soften concerns about a recession without prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws on the economy further.PacWest soared over 80 percent, after falling over 50 percent on Thursday. Western Alliance\u2019s share price rose almost 50 percent, also recouping a chunk of its drop the day before.The relief rally helped to lift the broader market, with the S&P 500 up 1.9 percent, its first day of gains in May.\n\u201cWe thought the banks were unfairly punished over the past week, and even before that,\u201d said Matt Peron, the director of research at Janus Henderson, an asset manager. \u201cThe rally makes sense because they were oversold.\u201dThe State of Jobs in the United StatesToo Few Workers: Employers in Vermont are battling a labor shortage as the local population grows older. The state\u2019s struggles offer an early look at where the rest of the country could be headed.Seasonal Hiring: After scrambling to fill out work forces the last few holiday seasons, many retailers are reporting more modest goals for temporary employment this year.Truck Drivers: The trucking industry has complained for years about a dire shortage of drivers. But some women say many companies have made it effectively impossible for them to get those jobs.A Surge in Start-ups: The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the U.S. economy in a lot of ways. But it might have also broken America out of a decades-long entrepreneurial slump.Still, the gains weren\u2019t enough to reverse another bruising week for the nation\u2019s midsize banks. The seizure and sale of First Republic to JPMorgan Chase on Monday was presented by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, ushering in the end of the crisis that began in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.However, Mr. Dimon added that there \u201cmay be another smaller\u201d bank to run into trouble. Shortly thereafter, a fresh bout of pressure clobbered the stocks of smaller lenders like PacWest and Western Alliance, which tried to reassure investors that their deposit bases were stable and that the market moves were unrelated to their financial health.Even with Friday\u2019s bounce, PacWest remained set to end the week having lost nearly half its market value. Western Alliance ended roughly a quarter below where it started the week. The S&P 500 ended the week 0.8 percent lower.After trading ended on Friday, the Federal Reserve released data showing that deposits at commercial banks in the United States declined slightly in the week that ended April 26, falling to $17.17 trillion from $17.18 trillion in the week before. At domestically chartered banks, though, they ticked higher \u2014 to $15.96 trillion from $15.94 trillion previously. In either case, the data showed deposits had stabilized following much more sizable declines in March and early April.\nConcern over the fate of the regional lenders was further relieved by fresh data on Friday that showed a robust labor market, with the pace of new hiring in April coming in stronger than expected and workers still achieving elevated wage gains.Despite the strong numbers for April, downward revisions to data from earlier months show the longer-term trend of a slowing labor market persisted, and investors still expect Fed policymakers to pause on raising interest rates when they next meet in June.Elsewhere, oil prices rose, often a reflection of a brighter outlook for the global economy. They, too, bounced higher following a sharp decline earlier in the week.A further tailwind for the market came from Apple, which reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter, helping push its share price nearly 5 percent higher on Friday. Because of the size of the tech behemoth, its moves have more of an effect on the S&P 500 than any company in the index.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said that it is possible to slow the economy enough to stem inflation without tipping it into recession. Arguably, Friday\u2019s employment data supports that notion of a so-called soft landing.\nNonetheless, some investors remain on edge, even after Friday\u2019s bounce. The strong data nudged higher the possibility of a rate increase in June.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changing interest-rate expectations, also rose, climbing 0.16 percentage points to 3.9 percent \u2014 a big move for an asset that typically changes by hundredths of a percentage point each day, and a sign that investors think interest rates could stay higher for longer.\u201cThe market seems vulnerable to a shock,\u201d said Mr. Peron. \u201cWe are going to be cautious until we get through a pause.\u201dJeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After nearly a week of tumult, the specter of a billowing crisis over the banking industry appeared to ease, at least for the moment, as pressure began to lift on the midsize and regional lenders most in peril.Shares of First Republic, which over the weekend had to slap together a multibillion-dollar rescue package to shore up its finances, soared over 60 percent on Tuesday before giving back some of those gains and closing up 27 percent. Shares are still down by roughly two-thirds over the past five trading days.Western Alliance, previously a little-known Arizona bank, saw its stock shoot up 50 percent on Tuesday after Citadel, the investment giant run by the billionaire Ken Griffin, disclosed that it had taken a stake in the hard-hit lender, though that gain was pared back to 14 percent by the end of the day.Some of the worst-hit banks seemed to go to extreme lengths to put on a brave face, and they had some success doing so. Zions Bank of Salt Lake City convened an emergency forum featuring both senators from Utah. Its stock bounced back to a degree on Tuesday, as did shares of PacWest Bancorp of Los Angeles and Charles Schwab, the Texas financial conglomerate.\nThough the financial world was suddenly glued to news of banks that only the most obsessive observers would have earlier heard of, none of their chief executives would agree to be interviewed. Some sent out mass notes to customers that side stepped the most pressing questions of the moment: How much money was being withdrawn this week, and what was the plan if the outflows pressed on?One bank chief executive, Brad Tidwell of VeraBank, shared his personal cellphone number to all 70,000 depositors at his institution, which has roughly $4 billion in deposits. His phone lit up Monday and Tuesday with more than 50 text messages and around two dozen phone calls from customers, asking him for personal assurances that everything would turn out OK.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Some callers told him that with so many institutions sending out emails crammed with legal jargon to explain their financial positions, they just wanted a straight answer from him: Was their money safe, or not?\u201cI\u2019ve been telling everyone, \u2018When banks fail it\u2019s a big deal, but that doesn\u2019t mean your bank has the same issues,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tidwell said.\nWhile stock prices aren\u2019t a clear proxy for whether a bank is healthy or not, falling shares or even simply volatility in prices can set off panic in borrowers and lead to a bank run. The recent downturn in the industry, in fact, was set off in part by just that, when shares in Silicon Valley Bank, a technology-focused lender, plummeted after it disclosed plans to raise money that it needed to pay out some depositors.\nLess than two days later, Silicon Valley Bank, which had roughly $175 billion in deposits, was taken over by federal regulators, making it the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Shares in other relatively small institutions have since fallen precipitously on fears that they, too, could be insolvent, though thus far only one other bank, Signature Bank, has been seized by regulators.On Sunday, federal officials committed to paying out depositors at those fallen banks in full, even if the banks did not have sufficient money. Depositors reported Monday that they were able to take out funds, an enormous relief to employers and individuals who had been worried about when and if they would regain access to their money.Officials stressed, however, that stock and bond holders in the banks themselves would still be in line to lose money on their investments.Investors seem to be assuming that the federal backstop applied to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature would also apply to other institutions, said Greg Hertrich, a U.S. bank strategist at Nomura and a bank executive for more than three decades.\n\u201cHaving been through a bunch of these, I can say: This one\u2019s moving fast,\u201d Mr. Hertrich said. \u201cThere are people who seem to believe that every deposit account is guaranteed without limit. I have not seen any indication that is what regulators have expressed.\u201d\nFor the first day since Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s unwinding, there were no widespread reports of customers being denied the chance to withdraw money from ATMs and bank branches. It appeared that the worst fears of widespread cash shortages were contained for now.Yet much uncertainty remains. As bank shares were recovering and branches returned to normalcy on Tuesday, only a few institutions had provided extensive updates about the degree to which skittish customers were pulling out their money.On Monday, First Republic\u2019s executive chairman, Jim Herbert, told CNBC in an off-camera interview that the bank was not experiencing an unusual level of withdrawals, a pronouncement that the anchors on the set greeted with visible skepticism. The bank did not respond to inquiries from The New York Times about the statement.\nCharles Schwab\u2019s chief executive, Walter Bettinger, boasted in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that his firm had seen positive incoming deposits this month overall, but neither he nor a Schwab spokeswoman would provide figures for this week, when Schwab\u2019s stock has been under the most acute pressure. Mr. Bettinger said he had bought roughly $3 million in new shares Tuesday to show his faith in the company.Zions, whose ties to the Mormon Church stretch back to the bank\u2019s first president, Brigham Young, has been similarly vague. On Monday, the company held a forum with high-profile political guests, including not just both senators but the governor as well. Scott Anderson, the bank\u2019s chief executive, opened by reading a script that noted Zions had a more diversified business base than Silicon Valley Bank, but he did not take questions or provide new information about his organization\u2019s financial base during the crisis.Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who was at the event, compared the situation to the film \u201cEverything, Everywhere All at Once,\u201d which won seven Academy Awards the night before. \u201cThis is a lot of stuff that happened at the same time,\u201d Mr. Romney said.Mr. Tidwell, the bank chief executive who shared his cellphone number, said he was watching stock prices of his larger rivals get whiplash.\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business long enough to know that we are one news cycle away from the angst getting even worse.\u201d",

	"text": "The unexpected seizure of two banks in three days by regulators intensified fears of a broader financial crisis, sending the stocks of more than two dozen banks into free fall on Monday, even as President Biden reassured Americans that the banking system was resilient and that customers\u2019 money was safe.Banks of various sizes in different parts of the country \u2014 from San Francisco-based First Republic Bank to Salt Lake City-based Zions Bank \u2014 found themselves battling market turmoil as customers rushed to withdraw their deposits and investors, worried about more runs, dumped bank stocks.In a brief televised statement from the White House shortly before the U.S. markets opened, Mr. Biden said that the government was responding decisively to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in ways that would protect depositors without rewarding risk-taking executives and investors.\u201cAmericans can rest assured that our banking system is safe \u2014 your deposits are safe,\u201d the president said. \u201cLet me also assure you we will not stop at this; we\u2019ll do whatever is needed.\u201d\nMr. Biden\u2019s comments didn\u2019t immediately appear to assuage investors, as shares of banks large and small closed the day in the red, with the KBW Bank Index, a proxy for the industry, down nearly 12 percent. On a day when the S&P 500 stock index ended up flat, shares of First Republic tumbled 60 percent and Western Alliance slumped 45 percent.Despite the echoes of the 2008 financial crisis, when 465 banks failed within four years, sometimes dozens in a month, regulators and banking officials were quick to insist that the current panic is far more contained, and that the banks whose stocks tanked had enough funds to meet their obligations.Last week, Silvergate, a cryptocurrency focused bank, said it would shut down; between Friday and Sunday, the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.On Monday, the Federal Reserve announced that it would conduct a review of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s oversight. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, on whose board the former chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank, Gregory Becker, sat until Friday, was responsible for supervising the failed bank.\u201cThe events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank demand a thorough, transparent and swift review by the Federal Reserve,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in a release.\nRegulators decided to shut down Signature Bank after it \u201cfailed to provide reliable data and created a lack of confidence in the bank\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Adrienne A. Harris, New York State\u2019s superintendent of financial services.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cEveryone is breathing hard today, and maybe I\u2019m missing it, but I think everything should settle down,\u201d Lloyd Blankfein, who was the chief executive of Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial crisis, said in an interview.It was hard to tell whether shareholders were reacting to actual vulnerabilities they spotted in the financials of those companies, or to the possibility that they would meet the same fate as Silicon Valley and Signature. Neither was there an obvious reason for why companies as large as Charles Schwab, with roughly $350 billion in deposits, and as small as Western Alliance, with $62 billion in deposits, got caught in the cross hairs. Silicon Valley Bank had roughly $175 billion in deposits before last week, and Signature had under $100 billion before it was shut down.\u201cSchwab has gotten a lot bigger, and the question is: Did they make the same mistakes SVB did?\u201d asked Robert Siegel, a business school lecturer at Stanford.Schwab released a statement Monday saying it was \u201cwell positioned to navigate the current environment,\u201d and called itself \u201ca safe port in a storm.\u201d\nAnticipating a blood bath on Monday, First Republic, the nation\u2019s 14th largest bank, said a day earlier that it could grab $70 billion if needed from sources including the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Its shares still lost nearly three-fifths of their value on Monday \u2014 at one point touching $30, a low they had not touched since the end of 2010.\nPacWest Bancorp, a Los Angeles bank that lends to small and medium-sized businesses, also sought to quell concerns about its stability, emphasizing on Monday that it had access to $14 billion in funds through a mix of cash, easily sellable securities, a credit line from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and access to the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window, a borrowing program that provides fast liquidity.The bank said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its customers had withdrawn some $700 million in deposits as of late last week, leaving PacWest with $33.2 billion in deposits and $41 billion in assets. Shares of PacWest plunged nearly 60 percent before recovering to end the day at $9.75, down 21 percent from Friday\u2019s closing.\u201cBank stock investors don\u2019t like uncertainty, and there\u2019s a lot of that right now,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays. \u201cYou have to be concerned that the lack of stock market confidence leads to a lack of depositor confidence.\u201d\nEven if a bank\u2019s stock price is not directly correlated to the strength of its balance sheet, Mr. Goldberg said, investors and depositors often end up using market performance as an indicator of financial health. So a loss of depositor confidence could mean a rush of withdrawals, which could drag down a bank.\u201cHopefully, all the regionals get through the day, aided by this new Fed facility,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said, referring to the central bank\u2019s emergency program offering banks favorable one-year loans in return for collateral, \u201cand tomorrow, cooler heads prevail.\u201dRegional banks \u2014 and even some banks with a national presence \u2014 lack the name recognition of banking Goliaths like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Yet, they play a vital role in supporting local businesses nationwide, like law firms, real estate developers, veterinarians\u2019 offices, retail shops and restaurants. Many banks also provide wealth management and private banking services, and they serve as the primary bank for individual savers.Zions, a Salt Lake City bank whose stock plummeted on Monday, was a large loan provider when the Small Business Administration started its Paycheck Protection Program in 2020 to help local businesses struggling to survive during the pandemic.\nOn Monday afternoon, executives of Zions held a private briefing for analysts to assuage concerns that they could be the next to fall. The bank turned down their requests to provide a formal update on whether depositors were pulling their cash, according to a bank executive who was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSmaller banks are especially vulnerable to financial panic, including those institutions that focus on certain groups of customers. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, followed by the federal government\u2019s closure of Signature Bank on Sunday, highlighted that.Silicon Valley catered mainly to the technology start-up community, and Signature Bank was a big lender to New York\u2019s legal and real estate industries. So even if their troubles didn\u2019t pose a widespread systemic risk, the two banks were central enough to those industries that bank runs would be extremely destabilizing, said Tyler Gellasch, president of Healthy Markets Association, an advocate for greater transparency in financial markets.\u201cIf Signature happened in a vacuum, we probably don\u2019t see this regulatory action,\u201d Mr. Gellasch said. \u201cOn each coast, we have bank failures that are uniquely focused on very wealthy and very connected industries.\u201dIt didn\u2019t help that Signature Bank also made a big play for cryptocurrency deposits \u2014 an area that many big banks were wary of entering, or prevented from doing so by stringent regulation. When the crypto bubble burst, the value of billions of dollars of customer deposits fell, leaving Signature on perilous ground.\nAt various banks, depositors \u2014 especially those with business accounts that hold more than $250,000 \u2014 were also concerned that they would lose much of their money because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits of up to $250,000. On Sunday, the F.D.I.C. said that all customers of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank with deposits above $250,000 would be made whole.Jamie Dupree, a San Francisco lawyer with accounts in the seven-figure range at First Republic, said she spent hours consulting with her banker there about how to proceed. Though Ms. Dupree was loath to contribute to panic, she felt she had no choice but to transfer some of her money to a larger institution.\u201cPersonally, I did not want to be part of a run, but I also didn\u2019t want to be economically vulnerable,\u201d said Ms. Dupree, who moved part of her money.\nMidsize banks like First Republic and PacWest sit between the handful of household-name banks with assets of $1 trillion or more, and tiny community banks that serve neighborhood businesses and customers. They play a crucial role in supplying businesses of a certain size with loans to grow.\nWhen Will York, the owner of Thunder Road Guitars PDX in Portland, Ore., wanted to buy a building for his growing guitar shop, his sales agent steered him toward regional lenders rather than Wells Fargo, where he had been a customer for decades. Bigger banks had little interest in the $1.1 million loan he needed \u2014 puny by their standards, but enormous by his.\u201cThe person from PacWest came in and spoke to me like I wasn\u2019t an idiot,\u201d Mr. York, 36, said. Even better, the bank put together a financing package, using a combination of its own money and a government loan backed by the Small Business Administration, to cover the entire cost of the 3,200-square-foot building Mr. York closed on in late 2021.\u201cOwning a building has been a goal of mine since even before I opened my store,\u201d he said. \u201cI absolutely could not have done it without PacWest.\u201dMatthew Goldstein Peter Baker and Joe Rennison contributed to this report.",

	"text": "The stock market\u2019s monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market\u2019s summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.Don\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I\u2019d prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.But that\u2019s a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur. \nThat\u2019s why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.The Stock Market\u2019s MovementsThat is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. In that period, the S&P 500 has returned 552.31 percent, or 7.8 percent, annualized, but to garner those handsome returns, an investor would have had to sit tight through countless downturns.While August has so far been a negative month for the stock market, there have been no major downturns this year. Through July, the S&P 500 rose for five consecutive months. Just seven big tech stocks \u2014 Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (Google) \u2014 accounted for more than two-thirds of the S&P 500\u2019s gains.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.This year, through July, the S&P 500 rose 19.5 percent, for a total return, including dividends, of 20.7 percent. Those were splendid numbers, but the market had been rising so rapidly on such a narrow base that it seemed to me that it was setting itself up for a fall.What\u2019s more, from a market bottom on Oct. 11, 2022, through July, the S&P 500 gained 27.9 percent, for a total return of 29.6 percent including dividends. In June, when the market had gained 20 percent from its October low, many commentators declared that the bear market that started on Jan. 3, 2022, was over, and that a new bull market had begun.\nMr. Silverblatt did not agree, because the market had not returned to its peak of Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 stood at 4,796.56, almost 9 percent above its current level. By his definition, it won\u2019t be clear that the S&P 500 is in a bull market until it climbs back to that level. Categorizing the market this way, as either bull or bear, is a straightforward retrospective judgment, not an assertion of the market\u2019s future direction, which no one can forecast accurately.This cautious way of thinking about the market is one I favor.I\u2019m not sure what the rally that started in October will amount to, but based on history, the summer swoon could be a good thing.The stock market\u2019s problems in August stem, at least partly, from shifts in the fixed-income markets: a sharp rise in short-term interest rates underway since the start of 2022, and a surge in long-term rates since June.The Lure of Fixed IncomeThanks to the rise in short-term rates, it\u2019s possible to get a great return on cash. Money market funds provide yields well above 5 percent.Bond yields have risen this summer, and they are now high enough to make bonds, with their safer profiles, an attractive alternative to stocks. And many factors driving up yields are negative for stocks, too.\nBriefly put, short-term rates \u2014 those embodied in money-market funds as well as credit cards \u2014 are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to reduce inflation. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy, mainly by raising the short-term rates it controls, the best known being the federal funds rate.On Friday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said that until there is conclusive evidence that inflation has been tamed, the central bank will maintain these rate levels or take them higher.Longer-term interest rates \u2014 those for bonds and mortgages \u2014 have been rising, too. But these rates are complicated. They are set in the vast bond market.By bidding down bond prices and raising yields (prices and yields move in opposite directions, as a matter of basic bond-market math), traders have indicated that they consider the economy to be stronger and inflation to be more persistent than had been expected a few months ago. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency also contributed to the run-up in rates on Treasury securities. And because Treasuries serve as benchmarks for virtually every other bond and, indeed, for every other investment in the global economy, higher rates have made stocks less appealing in comparison.In addition, the balance of supply and demand in the bond market has been tilting in a way that is contributing to higher rates. The Treasury has been auctioning an unusually large amount of debt, bulking up its resources after the brinkmanship of the debt ceiling crisis this spring. That increase in the supply of Treasuries coincides with a reduction in demand from several important sources: The Federal Reserve is no longer purchasing bonds, while the appetite for Treasuries from Japan and China has begun to flag, too.\nAll these factors have contributed to the run-up in yields, and they are weighing on stocks.Reading the EconomyFurthermore, one core issue assessed by bond buyers \u2014 the prospects for economic growth or recession in the United States and elsewhere around the world \u2014 has obsessed stock traders, too. But, at the moment, the U.S. economy is extraordinarily difficult to decipher.Higher interest rates might have been expected to slow down the economy by now, or throw it into recession. A waning of economic growth in China might also be expected to be a drag on the U.S. economy.But the U.S. economy and the job market, in particular, have been remarkably resilient, and consumer spending remains strong. As a consequence, corporate earnings in many sectors have exceeded Wall Street\u2019s muted expectations. If a recession were to develop, however, the outlook would be much worse.All that said, there are many reasons for optimism. In July, the market rally broadened substantially, with the stocks of smaller companies outperforming the giants, and every domestic sector posting gains. It was just what a stock investor would want to see in a market with sustainable upward momentum.Even the surge in interest rates could turn out to be innocuous. After all, it has returned rates to a level deemed healthy in previous economic cycles. Since January 1962, 10-year Treasury yields have averaged 4.2 percent \u2014 not far from where they are now. The appropriate level for interest rates for the rest of this decade is being debated at the Fed and among a broad range of economists.\nIn short, uncertainty about inflation and the Fed\u2019s response to it are well-founded. The paths of the markets and the economy may meander inconclusively for a while, thwarting anyone who wants to place a decisive bet one way or another.But it\u2019s a complicated world. Binary distinctions like bull market and bear market reduce complexity to simple notions that investors can grab onto. But I think these, in particular, are the wrong notions.The bull and bear market labels imply future action.In a bull market, stocks, for the most part, rise. In a bear market, more often than not, they fall. You might assume that you should avoid bear markets and welcome bull markets. But that\u2019s not a wise course for long-term investors, who are better off buying when prices are low and selling only at moments of their own choosing.I\u2019m bullish about the stock market for the long haul. But that\u2019s very different from believing that we are in a bull market or a bear right now. I just don\u2019t know and don\u2019t really care.Instead, I\u2019m investing for the long run, without trying to time market movements or pick individual stocks or bonds. I hold a piece of the world\u2019s entire stock and bond markets \u2014 not just the S&P 500 \u2014 through low-cost, broadly diversified index funds, and have been hanging in for decades.\nMarket rallies are fun, and it\u2019s a letdown when they take a breather. But an August pause could be just the thing the stock market needs. I worry about lots of things, but not that. Enjoy the rest of the summer.",

	"text": "It\u2019s awfully hard to beat the stock market consistently. In 2022, despite many advantages, most mutual funds couldn\u2019t do it. There are important lessons in that failure for this year and beyond.Recall that the S&P 500\u00a0declined 19.4 percent last year. It was a miserable\u00a0time\u00a0for just about anyone who held stocks, including\u00a0those who merely tried to match the overall market, as I do, using broadly diversified, low-cost index funds. But beneath the market\u2019s surface\u00a0last year, there were plenty of opportunities\u00a0that should have given active stock pickers a competitive advantage over index funds. That\u2019s because the average stock did better than the overall market, which was heavily influenced by a relative handful of \u201cmegacap\u201d tech stocks like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These giants declined sharply, but the rest of the market did markedly better.That meant the odds actually favored stock pickers last year. They had plenty of companies to choose from, any one of which would have given them a better performance than the overall market. And, in fact, as a group, actively managed mutual funds fared better against the overall market average than they have since 2009.\nEven so, the average actively managed stock mutual fund failed to beat the S&P 500. In an interview, Anu R. Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, summarized that mediocre performance this way. \u201cActively managed funds underperformed less badly in 2022 than they have in most years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they still underperformed.\u201dTailwinds Helped, but Not MuchIn some respects, the failure of actively managed mutual funds to beat the broad market indexes last year is unsurprising. S&P Dow Jones Indices has been running systematic comparisons of actively managed funds and passively managed funds \u2014 a.k.a. index funds \u2014 since 2001.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.These studies have consistently found that the vast majority of active fund managers just can\u2019t beat the indexes over 10- or 20-year periods, or in most individual years, either.From 2010 through 2021, anywhere from 55 percent to 87 percent of actively managed funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks couldn\u2019t beat that benchmark in any given year.Compared with that, the results for 2022 were cause for celebration: About 51 percent of large-cap stock funds failed to beat the S&P 500.\nActive managers couldn\u2019t quite achieve what random chance would predict \u2014 that 50 percent of actively managed funds would beat the index.In other words, their performance for 2022 looks slightly worse than the results of a random coin flip.That\u2019s unimpressive, but it was much worse over longer periods. Consider these tallies for funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks through the end of 2022:Over three years, 74.3 percent of actively managed funds trailed the index.Over five years, 86.5 percent underperformed.Over 10 years, 91.4 percent underperformed.Over 20 years, 94.8 percent underperformed.As the numbers show, the longer you ran the horse race, the more actively managed funds fell behind.Over 20 years through April 11, the SPDR\u00a0S&P 500 E.T.F. \u2014 one of the many mutual funds and exchange-traded index funds that track the S&P 500 \u2014 returned nearly 10 percent, annualized. The vast majority of active, stock-picking funds couldn\u2019t match that.The Odds Have Gotten WorseWhen you look carefully at the results for 2022, the performance of actively managed funds is much worse than it may seem at first glance, because it really wasn\u2019t a coin flip.\nFor the stock market, 2022 was a special year. If there was any year in which stock pickers should have been able to outperform the broad market indexes, 2022 was it, yet most still couldn\u2019t beat the battered stock market.That augurs poorly for active managers in 2023 because, so far at least, the odds have shifted.Once again, consider \u201cmegacap\u201d tech stocks, which had terrible performances last year \u2014 much worse than the S&P 500 as a whole. The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, which means that the most valuable stocks in the markets, like those from the big tech companies, have an outsize effect on stock market returns. When they decline, the overall index tends to decline. When they rise, the overall market tends to rise. Often the market moves in lock step, with many stocks heading in the same direction.But last year, the monthly \u201cdispersion\u201d of the S&P 500, which measures \u201cthe magnitude of differences\u201d in the returns of individual stocks in the index, was at its highest level since 2009. This means that there was more variation in stock returns, and most individual stocks did much better than the megacap stocks. You can see this by comparing the standard S&P 500 with an equal-weighted version, in which a stock like Dish Network, with a market capitalization of less than $5 billion, has the same weight as a colossus like Apple, with a market cap of well over $2 trillion.In 2022, the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperformed the standard index by nearly seven percentage points. That implies that if you just picked stocks randomly last year, you should have done better than the overall index because the typical random stock did better than the megacaps and better than the S&P 500. But most active managers couldn\u2019t do it.Their chances are worse this year because the market so far has been very different. Megacap stocks have been outperforming the average stock in the S&P 500 index, and the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has been trailing the standard, cap-weighted index. That implies that if you just pick stocks randomly, odds are that you will trail the overall stock market this year.\nAnd, in fact, preliminary tallies by Bank of America show that in a horse race between active large-cap\u00a0mutual fund managers and the S&P 500 this year, the active managers have been clobbered. Only 45 percent of active large-cap stock managers have matched the performance of the S&P 500. Stock pickers are doing better in some corners of the market, but for the most part, it\u2019s a dismal pictureImproving Your ChancesIt\u2019s definitely possible to beat the stock market. A small number of people will probably to do it over the next 20 years. But I don\u2019t know now who those outliers will be. Similarly, I don\u2019t know the precise direction of\u00a0the economy or of inflation or of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies or of a host of other\u00a0monumentally important factors. No one else knows, either.That\u2019s why I think it makes sense to embrace humility, accept my limitations and use low-cost index funds to try to match the returns of the stock and bond markets over the long run.To do that, and to withstand the wrenching shifts in the markets that will surely come, I\u2019ll need enough cash on hand to pay the bills first. Money-market funds and high-yield, federally insured savings accounts and certificates of deposit are reasonable options for that purpose.Make your own choice. Some active stock pickers will beat the market averages this year. But based on history, I think it\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority won\u2019t manage to do it over the next 20 years.\nBecause I\u2019m trying to improve my odds while investing for the long haul, I\u2019m aiming for an absolutely average performance.",

	"text": "Wall Street strategists are issuing forecasts for the performance of the stock market in 2024.Pay them no mind.The predictions are usually wrong, and when they\u2019re right it\u2019s only by accident.Consider their prophecies for 2023. At the end of 2022, strategists predicted that the S&P 500 would end 2023 at 4,078, a gain of 6.2 percent from where it started, according to data from Bloomberg.At the moment, the market is above 4,700, a gain of more than 22 percent. These forecasts were so deeply off the mark undoubtedly because 2022 was a truly terrible year for stocks \u2014 and also one that most analysts totally failed to foresee. So the predictions for 2023 were uncharacteristically modest, reflecting the gloom that prevailed when they were being set.The median forecast on Dec. 19 called for the S&P 500 to close 2024 at 4,750, according to Bloomberg. The projections are still shifting \u2014 and will assuredly increase if the market keeps rising. When the market rises, the forecasts typically rise, too.\nThese forecasts aren\u2019t scientific, and I only bother to address them at all because they get a tremendous amount of coverage, and they inform the advice given to thousands, and perhaps millions, of people.If you find them entertaining or otherwise illuminating \u2014 wonderful. Enjoy them.But at all costs, don\u2019t take them at face value because there is no evidence that anyone can predict the market\u2019s movements reliably, and a great deal of evidence that buying and selling stock on the basis of your views about the market\u2019s impending movements is a fool\u2019s game.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Better to invest with humility: Accept that no one knows where the market is going moment by moment, and focus on the long haul, anyway.The Big PictureOver many decades, the entire global stock market has trended upward, and as long as capitalism survives, and companies continue to profit, the stock market as a whole is likely to climb. But it certainly won\u2019t do so all the time. If you\u2019ve been in the market at all, you know that it rises and falls. These movements are, for the most part, unpredictable.Yet Wall Street strategists make predictions anyway, despite a track record that is extraordinary in its ineptitude.\nBack in 2020, using data compiled by Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, I found that since 2000 Wall Street frequently got the direction of the market wrong. At my request, Mr. Hickey has updated the data.The numbers show that from 2000 through 2023, the median Wall Street analyst forecast that the S&P 500 would rise 9 percent a year, on average. In reality, the annual increase averaged 6 percent.Even these figures understate the degree of failure.In 2018, for example, the market fell 6.9 percent, though the forecasters said it would rise 7.5 percent, a 14.4 percentage point difference. In 2002, the forecast called for an increase of 12.5 percent, but stocks fell 23.3 percent, a spread of almost 36 percentage points.And in 2022, the forecast called for an annual increase of 3.9 percent. But the stock market lost 19.4 percent. The forecasters were wrong by a margin of more than 23 percentage points.Taking gaps like these into account, the median Wall Street forecast from 2000 through 2023 missed its target by an average 13.8 percentage points annually \u2014 more than double the actual average annual performance of the stock market.\nThe Situation NowMany Wall Street strategists are astute analysts of what has already happened. But the economy and the markets shift constantly, in unexpected ways. Reliably forecasting stock market averages 12 months in advance is beyond anybody\u2019s ability.Declining inflation combined with a robust labor market has led many people to believe that the Federal Reserve will soon be cutting the short-term interest rates that it controls directly. This is seen as bullish for the stock market, which has risen in the past couple of months. The S&P 500 is on the verge of surpassing its last peak, reached in January. And if there is no recession in the next year, and interest rates do decline, it\u2019s reasonable to think that the market will keep rising.That, in a nutshell, is the bullish case. But it\u2019s easy to conjure up bearish alternatives, too.For example, if the Fed cuts interest rates prematurely, inflation could surge. The central bank may then need to raise interest rates again, as Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chair, had to do in 1981, setting off a second recession in two years.A \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy in 2024 could be coming. But so could a recession.David Rosenberg, a veteran strategist and economist, is still predicting one, as he has since early 2022. He expects the economy to falter, interest rates to plummet and stocks to fall. \u201cTreasury bonds, not the stock market, will be the best performing asset class in 2024,\u201d he told me in an interview.Given the complexity of the world and all of the crises, big and small, that are already obvious, it would take a very long column to sketch out all of the things that could go wrong with a forecast about the next year. And I\u2019m certain that there will be major shifts that few people yet imagine.\nFortunately, you don\u2019t have to know these things to be a successful investor.The key, first of all, is to have enough money set aside to pay the bills, because investment involves some risk, and you don\u2019t want to take risks with money you absolutely need. Then, to minimize your risks while holding stocks, resolve to invest in the entire market for decades through low-cost diversified index funds, and avoid any attempt at timing the market. Wall Street predictions might tempt you to buy and sell at the wrong times. It\u2019s safer to ignore these forecasts entirely.Stocks are just part of the program. I also invest in high-quality bonds and do so the same way, with broad, low-cost index funds. Investment-grade bonds, and especially Treasuries, usually provide a buffer when stocks fall (though they didn\u2019t do so in 2022). Treasuries, in particular, are safe investments, despite the fiscal strains resulting from the failure of the U.S. government in recent years to reach consensus on spending and taxation policies.I find these forecasting exercises fascinating, and sometimes learn a great deal from them, but I don\u2019t expect any of them to provide a road map to the future.Hope for the best, prepare for the worst and get on with life. Unfortunately, Wall Street forecasts won\u2019t help with any of that.",

	"text": "Wall Street\u2019s worries eased on Tuesday, as investors took comfort from signs that a potential banking crisis appeared contained and bet on a more supportive environment for the economy going forward.The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent, lifted by a recovery in some bank stocks and bolstered by gains for heavyweights like Microsoft and Apple, which because of their size have a bigger impact on the performance of the broader index. More than three-quarters of the stocks in the index rose on Tuesday.It\u2019s common for stocks to bounce after a substantial fall, as investors try to gauge where markets will shake out once a period of stress passes. Nonetheless, the lift in the market was a welcome reprieve for investors who have been battered by a rapidly shifting economic backdrop that has led to whipsaw moves across stock and bond markets.One dominant narrative taking shape posits that the crisis in the banking sector may lead to a more supportive environment for markets. The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank appears contained, and the episode may also give the Federal Reserve reason to forgo further interest rate increases. Higher interest rates raise costs for companies and were at the root of the stress in the banking sector, so fewer rate increases could help stocks to rebound.\n\u201cThis is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cAbsent further deterioration in regional banks, I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Fresh inflation data on Tuesday appeared to show just enough cooling to support the case for a more restrained Fed. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation slowing slightly for the year through February, despite accelerating from the previous month.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Investors\u2019 bets on whether the Fed will raise interest rates when it meets next week tilted back to expecting a quarter-point increase, after briefly flirting with no change, still markedly lower than where expectations stood a week ago. Investors now expect the central bank to raise interest rates to a peak of around 4.9 percent, down sharply from around 5.5 percent last week. That implies an expectation of one more quarter-point increase to come, down from as many as four such increases a week ago.In the bond market, sentiment appeared less hopeful. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, rose by more than 0.2 percentage points \u2014 a big move for an asset that usually moves in tiny fractions of a percentage point. Tuesday\u2019s rise followed a deep fall on Monday that echoed painful flash points such as the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Though the yield on the 10-year Treasury note still rose, it remained more anchored, suggesting fading hopes for economic growth over the long term.\n\u201cI think what is reflected in the bond market is an elevated risk of recession and a credit crunch, but for whatever reason it hasn\u2019t reached stock investors yet,\u201d Ms. Sonders said.That dissonance makes predicting the path forward even harder, with some investors warning that financial markets could be headed for more days of volatile trading as investors make sense of the murky outlook.\u201cPeople are trying to gauge what the Fed is actually going to do given all the new information since the end of last week,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. \u201cI think there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The Fed really has a dilemma on its hands here.\u201d",

	"text": "Investors swiftly reshuffled their portfolios this week, as they absorbed the Federal Reserve\u2019s signals and prepared for the effects of higher interest rates for longer than they had previously thought.Stock prices slumped, the dollar soared and bond yields crept higher after the Fed meeting on Wednesday: Despite holding rates steady, a shift in Fed policymakers\u2019 predictions about how long they expected to hold interest rates at high levels prompted a sharp reassessment on Wall Street.The S&P 500 index slumped lower for the third consecutive week, despite paring some of its losses on Friday with a modest gain. It ended the week down close to 3 percent, its worst weekly performance since March, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.The yields on longer-dated bonds, which serve as a gauge of the cost of corporate borrowing and can weigh on stock prices, rose to levels last seen in the buildup to the 2008 financial crisis. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly moved above 4.5 percent, its highest since September 2007, up roughly half a percentage point so far this month, a sizable move in that market.\nInvestors yanked nearly $18 billion from stock markets in the United States in the week through Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global, the most in a week since late 2022, and that was before the Fed\u2019s announcements pushed yields even higher.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The stock market\u2019s rate-sensitive areas, such as technology stocks, have been particularly hard hit. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6 percent for the week.\u201cInvestors appear concerned that keeping rates higher for longer will weigh on equity valuations and make it harder for the Fed to achieve a soft economic landing,\u201d Keith Lerner of Truist said in a research note on Friday.Our business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Fed officials now predict that interest rates will end next year at 5.1 percent, according to the median projection by policymakers, markedly higher than their 4.6 percent forecast in June.The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and many economists have expressed hope that the economy can remain resilient despite the squeeze from higher interest rates. Higher interest rates are still making their way through the economy, confronting consumers when they refinance mortgages or take out new loans, and hitting companies when they roll over debt fixed when interest rates were much lower.\nIt\u2019s partly because the economy has held up so well that the Fed expects to have to do more to try and slow it down in order to tame stubborn inflation, while trying to avoid tipping it into recession. That economic resilience should mean that the stock market \u201ccan handle higher bond yields better,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank noted.The stock market remains about 13 percent up from the start of the year, despite sharply higher interest rates. But investors are wary of putting too much confidence in predictions for the path of rates in the future.In January, trading in financial markets implied that the Fed would be cutting rates as soon as this month. Now, investors expect rate cuts to begin in the second half of next year.\u201cForecasting is very difficult,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cForecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.\u201dIn the next few months, investors must contend with the autoworkers\u2019 strike, the restart of student loan repayments and the threat of a government shutdown.\u201cThere is a lack of upside catalyst in the near term to get more bullish about,\u201d Mr. Lerner of Truist said.",

	"text": "The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday had a glitch that led to wild price swings that affected over 250 stocks, including shares of large companies like Wells Fargo, Verizon and Nike.Shares of Nike fell more than 12 percent immediately after trading began at 9:30 a.m. in New York. In less than a second, Verizon swung between a loss of over 17 percent and a gain of nearly 13 percent, while Wells Fargo plummeted more than 15 percent.The moves, which added or wiped out billions of dollars of market value, led the exchange to halt trading in just over 80 different shares. Stock exchanges have built-in \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d that automatically pause trading if a stock price suddenly swings by a large amount.Once trading resumed, the companies\u2019 share prices moved more or less in line with a typical trading day. Shares of Nike, Verizon and Wells Fargo, for example, had gained or lost less than 2 percent by the end of trading on Tuesday.\nThe explanation for the turmoil, the exchange said, was a malfunction in its system at a crucial time for the financial markets. Typically, the N.Y.S.E. holds an opening auction at the start of trading day, collecting orders from buyers and sellers to set the opening price of individual stocks. The exchange said that for some stocks \u201copening auctions did not occur,\u201d resulting in the market mayhem.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The whipsaw trading meant some investors will have paid much more to buy shares than the prevailing market price, while others paid much less. Some investors said their trades simply weren\u2019t executed, with significantly reduced trading volumes. Traders said they expected much of the activity to be reversed.\u201cSomebody is having an unhappy day,\u201d said Edward Monrad, head of market structure at Optiver, a so-called market maker, which is a type of business expected to buy and sell shares to facilitate trading. \u201cThose trades will most likely get busted, which means people are sitting on trades that they are uncertain exist.\u201dBy the afternoon, the N.Y.S.E. said its member firms could flag erroneous trades or request compensation for losses arising from Tuesday\u2019s events, in accordance with its rules. The exchange later said some trades in over 250 stocks would automatically be declared \u201cnull and void.\u201dSome investors had earlier raised concerns about the extent of the price moves, before circuit breakers were set off. Exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. use what are known as \u201climit up, limit down\u201d triggers to stop trading in a stock if its price moves too much, too quickly.\nAt the open, this is typically set at 5 percent or 10 percent above and below the stock\u2019s opening price. These triggers are designed to protect investors from sharp moves, allowing markets a moment to pause and reset prices before they spiral out of control.Trade data shows, however, that some transactions were executed outside these ranges.The tobacco company Altria ended Monday at a price of $44.81. It opened on Tuesday up over 15 percent at $51.57, which appeared to set the stock\u2019s lower trading limit 5 percent lower at $48.99. Yet within milliseconds trades were executed around $47, $38, $42, $45 and $44 before the price jumped back to $48.99, according to reported trade data.Some of these trades were among those the N.Y.S.E. said it would reverse.Reversing trades, though, could create further problems for investors who were unsure if they had bought or sold stock, or not. This could also knock on to trades conducted on other exchanges affected by the volatility on the N.Y.S.E.",

	"text": "A group of regional bank stocks that came under severe pressure this week, stoking fears of a spiraling banking crisis, surged on Friday, at least partly alleviating those worries.The rebound came as the market was also bolstered by data on hiring that was deemed strong enough to soften concerns about a recession without prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws on the economy further.PacWest soared over 80 percent, after falling over 50 percent on Thursday. Western Alliance\u2019s share price rose almost 50 percent, also recouping a chunk of its drop the day before.The relief rally helped to lift the broader market, with the S&P 500 up 1.9 percent, its first day of gains in May.\n\u201cWe thought the banks were unfairly punished over the past week, and even before that,\u201d said Matt Peron, the director of research at Janus Henderson, an asset manager. \u201cThe rally makes sense because they were oversold.\u201dThe State of Jobs in the United StatesToo Few Workers: Employers in Vermont are battling a labor shortage as the local population grows older. The state\u2019s struggles offer an early look at where the rest of the country could be headed.Seasonal Hiring: After scrambling to fill out work forces the last few holiday seasons, many retailers are reporting more modest goals for temporary employment this year.Truck Drivers: The trucking industry has complained for years about a dire shortage of drivers. But some women say many companies have made it effectively impossible for them to get those jobs.A Surge in Start-ups: The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the U.S. economy in a lot of ways. But it might have also broken America out of a decades-long entrepreneurial slump.Still, the gains weren\u2019t enough to reverse another bruising week for the nation\u2019s midsize banks. The seizure and sale of First Republic to JPMorgan Chase on Monday was presented by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, ushering in the end of the crisis that began in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.However, Mr. Dimon added that there \u201cmay be another smaller\u201d bank to run into trouble. Shortly thereafter, a fresh bout of pressure clobbered the stocks of smaller lenders like PacWest and Western Alliance, which tried to reassure investors that their deposit bases were stable and that the market moves were unrelated to their financial health.Even with Friday\u2019s bounce, PacWest remained set to end the week having lost nearly half its market value. Western Alliance ended roughly a quarter below where it started the week. The S&P 500 ended the week 0.8 percent lower.After trading ended on Friday, the Federal Reserve released data showing that deposits at commercial banks in the United States declined slightly in the week that ended April 26, falling to $17.17 trillion from $17.18 trillion in the week before. At domestically chartered banks, though, they ticked higher \u2014 to $15.96 trillion from $15.94 trillion previously. In either case, the data showed deposits had stabilized following much more sizable declines in March and early April.\nConcern over the fate of the regional lenders was further relieved by fresh data on Friday that showed a robust labor market, with the pace of new hiring in April coming in stronger than expected and workers still achieving elevated wage gains.Despite the strong numbers for April, downward revisions to data from earlier months show the longer-term trend of a slowing labor market persisted, and investors still expect Fed policymakers to pause on raising interest rates when they next meet in June.Elsewhere, oil prices rose, often a reflection of a brighter outlook for the global economy. They, too, bounced higher following a sharp decline earlier in the week.A further tailwind for the market came from Apple, which reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter, helping push its share price nearly 5 percent higher on Friday. Because of the size of the tech behemoth, its moves have more of an effect on the S&P 500 than any company in the index.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said that it is possible to slow the economy enough to stem inflation without tipping it into recession. Arguably, Friday\u2019s employment data supports that notion of a so-called soft landing.\nNonetheless, some investors remain on edge, even after Friday\u2019s bounce. The strong data nudged higher the possibility of a rate increase in June.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changing interest-rate expectations, also rose, climbing 0.16 percentage points to 3.9 percent \u2014 a big move for an asset that typically changes by hundredths of a percentage point each day, and a sign that investors think interest rates could stay higher for longer.\u201cThe market seems vulnerable to a shock,\u201d said Mr. Peron. \u201cWe are going to be cautious until we get through a pause.\u201dJeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "After nearly a week of tumult, the specter of a billowing crisis over the banking industry appeared to ease, at least for the moment, as pressure began to lift on the midsize and regional lenders most in peril.Shares of First Republic, which over the weekend had to slap together a multibillion-dollar rescue package to shore up its finances, soared over 60 percent on Tuesday before giving back some of those gains and closing up 27 percent. Shares are still down by roughly two-thirds over the past five trading days.Western Alliance, previously a little-known Arizona bank, saw its stock shoot up 50 percent on Tuesday after Citadel, the investment giant run by the billionaire Ken Griffin, disclosed that it had taken a stake in the hard-hit lender, though that gain was pared back to 14 percent by the end of the day.Some of the worst-hit banks seemed to go to extreme lengths to put on a brave face, and they had some success doing so. Zions Bank of Salt Lake City convened an emergency forum featuring both senators from Utah. Its stock bounced back to a degree on Tuesday, as did shares of PacWest Bancorp of Los Angeles and Charles Schwab, the Texas financial conglomerate.\nThough the financial world was suddenly glued to news of banks that only the most obsessive observers would have earlier heard of, none of their chief executives would agree to be interviewed. Some sent out mass notes to customers that side stepped the most pressing questions of the moment: How much money was being withdrawn this week, and what was the plan if the outflows pressed on?One bank chief executive, Brad Tidwell of VeraBank, shared his personal cellphone number to all 70,000 depositors at his institution, which has roughly $4 billion in deposits. His phone lit up Monday and Tuesday with more than 50 text messages and around two dozen phone calls from customers, asking him for personal assurances that everything would turn out OK.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Some callers told him that with so many institutions sending out emails crammed with legal jargon to explain their financial positions, they just wanted a straight answer from him: Was their money safe, or not?\u201cI\u2019ve been telling everyone, \u2018When banks fail it\u2019s a big deal, but that doesn\u2019t mean your bank has the same issues,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tidwell said.\nWhile stock prices aren\u2019t a clear proxy for whether a bank is healthy or not, falling shares or even simply volatility in prices can set off panic in borrowers and lead to a bank run. The recent downturn in the industry, in fact, was set off in part by just that, when shares in Silicon Valley Bank, a technology-focused lender, plummeted after it disclosed plans to raise money that it needed to pay out some depositors.\nLess than two days later, Silicon Valley Bank, which had roughly $175 billion in deposits, was taken over by federal regulators, making it the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Shares in other relatively small institutions have since fallen precipitously on fears that they, too, could be insolvent, though thus far only one other bank, Signature Bank, has been seized by regulators.On Sunday, federal officials committed to paying out depositors at those fallen banks in full, even if the banks did not have sufficient money. Depositors reported Monday that they were able to take out funds, an enormous relief to employers and individuals who had been worried about when and if they would regain access to their money.Officials stressed, however, that stock and bond holders in the banks themselves would still be in line to lose money on their investments.Investors seem to be assuming that the federal backstop applied to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature would also apply to other institutions, said Greg Hertrich, a U.S. bank strategist at Nomura and a bank executive for more than three decades.\n\u201cHaving been through a bunch of these, I can say: This one\u2019s moving fast,\u201d Mr. Hertrich said. \u201cThere are people who seem to believe that every deposit account is guaranteed without limit. I have not seen any indication that is what regulators have expressed.\u201d\nFor the first day since Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s unwinding, there were no widespread reports of customers being denied the chance to withdraw money from ATMs and bank branches. It appeared that the worst fears of widespread cash shortages were contained for now.Yet much uncertainty remains. As bank shares were recovering and branches returned to normalcy on Tuesday, only a few institutions had provided extensive updates about the degree to which skittish customers were pulling out their money.On Monday, First Republic\u2019s executive chairman, Jim Herbert, told CNBC in an off-camera interview that the bank was not experiencing an unusual level of withdrawals, a pronouncement that the anchors on the set greeted with visible skepticism. The bank did not respond to inquiries from The New York Times about the statement.\nCharles Schwab\u2019s chief executive, Walter Bettinger, boasted in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that his firm had seen positive incoming deposits this month overall, but neither he nor a Schwab spokeswoman would provide figures for this week, when Schwab\u2019s stock has been under the most acute pressure. Mr. Bettinger said he had bought roughly $3 million in new shares Tuesday to show his faith in the company.Zions, whose ties to the Mormon Church stretch back to the bank\u2019s first president, Brigham Young, has been similarly vague. On Monday, the company held a forum with high-profile political guests, including not just both senators but the governor as well. Scott Anderson, the bank\u2019s chief executive, opened by reading a script that noted Zions had a more diversified business base than Silicon Valley Bank, but he did not take questions or provide new information about his organization\u2019s financial base during the crisis.Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who was at the event, compared the situation to the film \u201cEverything, Everywhere All at Once,\u201d which won seven Academy Awards the night before. \u201cThis is a lot of stuff that happened at the same time,\u201d Mr. Romney said.Mr. Tidwell, the bank chief executive who shared his cellphone number, said he was watching stock prices of his larger rivals get whiplash.\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business long enough to know that we are one news cycle away from the angst getting even worse.\u201d",

	"text": "The unexpected seizure of two banks in three days by regulators intensified fears of a broader financial crisis, sending the stocks of more than two dozen banks into free fall on Monday, even as President Biden reassured Americans that the banking system was resilient and that customers\u2019 money was safe.Banks of various sizes in different parts of the country \u2014 from San Francisco-based First Republic Bank to Salt Lake City-based Zions Bank \u2014 found themselves battling market turmoil as customers rushed to withdraw their deposits and investors, worried about more runs, dumped bank stocks.In a brief televised statement from the White House shortly before the U.S. markets opened, Mr. Biden said that the government was responding decisively to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in ways that would protect depositors without rewarding risk-taking executives and investors.\u201cAmericans can rest assured that our banking system is safe \u2014 your deposits are safe,\u201d the president said. \u201cLet me also assure you we will not stop at this; we\u2019ll do whatever is needed.\u201d\nMr. Biden\u2019s comments didn\u2019t immediately appear to assuage investors, as shares of banks large and small closed the day in the red, with the KBW Bank Index, a proxy for the industry, down nearly 12 percent. On a day when the S&P 500 stock index ended up flat, shares of First Republic tumbled 60 percent and Western Alliance slumped 45 percent.Despite the echoes of the 2008 financial crisis, when 465 banks failed within four years, sometimes dozens in a month, regulators and banking officials were quick to insist that the current panic is far more contained, and that the banks whose stocks tanked had enough funds to meet their obligations.Last week, Silvergate, a cryptocurrency focused bank, said it would shut down; between Friday and Sunday, the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.On Monday, the Federal Reserve announced that it would conduct a review of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s oversight. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, on whose board the former chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank, Gregory Becker, sat until Friday, was responsible for supervising the failed bank.\u201cThe events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank demand a thorough, transparent and swift review by the Federal Reserve,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in a release.\nRegulators decided to shut down Signature Bank after it \u201cfailed to provide reliable data and created a lack of confidence in the bank\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Adrienne A. Harris, New York State\u2019s superintendent of financial services.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cEveryone is breathing hard today, and maybe I\u2019m missing it, but I think everything should settle down,\u201d Lloyd Blankfein, who was the chief executive of Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial crisis, said in an interview.It was hard to tell whether shareholders were reacting to actual vulnerabilities they spotted in the financials of those companies, or to the possibility that they would meet the same fate as Silicon Valley and Signature. Neither was there an obvious reason for why companies as large as Charles Schwab, with roughly $350 billion in deposits, and as small as Western Alliance, with $62 billion in deposits, got caught in the cross hairs. Silicon Valley Bank had roughly $175 billion in deposits before last week, and Signature had under $100 billion before it was shut down.\u201cSchwab has gotten a lot bigger, and the question is: Did they make the same mistakes SVB did?\u201d asked Robert Siegel, a business school lecturer at Stanford.Schwab released a statement Monday saying it was \u201cwell positioned to navigate the current environment,\u201d and called itself \u201ca safe port in a storm.\u201d\nAnticipating a blood bath on Monday, First Republic, the nation\u2019s 14th largest bank, said a day earlier that it could grab $70 billion if needed from sources including the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Its shares still lost nearly three-fifths of their value on Monday \u2014 at one point touching $30, a low they had not touched since the end of 2010.\nPacWest Bancorp, a Los Angeles bank that lends to small and medium-sized businesses, also sought to quell concerns about its stability, emphasizing on Monday that it had access to $14 billion in funds through a mix of cash, easily sellable securities, a credit line from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and access to the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window, a borrowing program that provides fast liquidity.The bank said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its customers had withdrawn some $700 million in deposits as of late last week, leaving PacWest with $33.2 billion in deposits and $41 billion in assets. Shares of PacWest plunged nearly 60 percent before recovering to end the day at $9.75, down 21 percent from Friday\u2019s closing.\u201cBank stock investors don\u2019t like uncertainty, and there\u2019s a lot of that right now,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays. \u201cYou have to be concerned that the lack of stock market confidence leads to a lack of depositor confidence.\u201d\nEven if a bank\u2019s stock price is not directly correlated to the strength of its balance sheet, Mr. Goldberg said, investors and depositors often end up using market performance as an indicator of financial health. So a loss of depositor confidence could mean a rush of withdrawals, which could drag down a bank.\u201cHopefully, all the regionals get through the day, aided by this new Fed facility,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said, referring to the central bank\u2019s emergency program offering banks favorable one-year loans in return for collateral, \u201cand tomorrow, cooler heads prevail.\u201dRegional banks \u2014 and even some banks with a national presence \u2014 lack the name recognition of banking Goliaths like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Yet, they play a vital role in supporting local businesses nationwide, like law firms, real estate developers, veterinarians\u2019 offices, retail shops and restaurants. Many banks also provide wealth management and private banking services, and they serve as the primary bank for individual savers.Zions, a Salt Lake City bank whose stock plummeted on Monday, was a large loan provider when the Small Business Administration started its Paycheck Protection Program in 2020 to help local businesses struggling to survive during the pandemic.\nOn Monday afternoon, executives of Zions held a private briefing for analysts to assuage concerns that they could be the next to fall. The bank turned down their requests to provide a formal update on whether depositors were pulling their cash, according to a bank executive who was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSmaller banks are especially vulnerable to financial panic, including those institutions that focus on certain groups of customers. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, followed by the federal government\u2019s closure of Signature Bank on Sunday, highlighted that.Silicon Valley catered mainly to the technology start-up community, and Signature Bank was a big lender to New York\u2019s legal and real estate industries. So even if their troubles didn\u2019t pose a widespread systemic risk, the two banks were central enough to those industries that bank runs would be extremely destabilizing, said Tyler Gellasch, president of Healthy Markets Association, an advocate for greater transparency in financial markets.\u201cIf Signature happened in a vacuum, we probably don\u2019t see this regulatory action,\u201d Mr. Gellasch said. \u201cOn each coast, we have bank failures that are uniquely focused on very wealthy and very connected industries.\u201dIt didn\u2019t help that Signature Bank also made a big play for cryptocurrency deposits \u2014 an area that many big banks were wary of entering, or prevented from doing so by stringent regulation. When the crypto bubble burst, the value of billions of dollars of customer deposits fell, leaving Signature on perilous ground.\nAt various banks, depositors \u2014 especially those with business accounts that hold more than $250,000 \u2014 were also concerned that they would lose much of their money because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits of up to $250,000. On Sunday, the F.D.I.C. said that all customers of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank with deposits above $250,000 would be made whole.Jamie Dupree, a San Francisco lawyer with accounts in the seven-figure range at First Republic, said she spent hours consulting with her banker there about how to proceed. Though Ms. Dupree was loath to contribute to panic, she felt she had no choice but to transfer some of her money to a larger institution.\u201cPersonally, I did not want to be part of a run, but I also didn\u2019t want to be economically vulnerable,\u201d said Ms. Dupree, who moved part of her money.\nMidsize banks like First Republic and PacWest sit between the handful of household-name banks with assets of $1 trillion or more, and tiny community banks that serve neighborhood businesses and customers. They play a crucial role in supplying businesses of a certain size with loans to grow.\nWhen Will York, the owner of Thunder Road Guitars PDX in Portland, Ore., wanted to buy a building for his growing guitar shop, his sales agent steered him toward regional lenders rather than Wells Fargo, where he had been a customer for decades. Bigger banks had little interest in the $1.1 million loan he needed \u2014 puny by their standards, but enormous by his.\u201cThe person from PacWest came in and spoke to me like I wasn\u2019t an idiot,\u201d Mr. York, 36, said. Even better, the bank put together a financing package, using a combination of its own money and a government loan backed by the Small Business Administration, to cover the entire cost of the 3,200-square-foot building Mr. York closed on in late 2021.\u201cOwning a building has been a goal of mine since even before I opened my store,\u201d he said. \u201cI absolutely could not have done it without PacWest.\u201dMatthew Goldstein Peter Baker and Joe Rennison contributed to this report.",

	"text": "The stock market\u2019s monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market\u2019s summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.Don\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I\u2019d prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.But that\u2019s a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur. \nThat\u2019s why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.The Stock Market\u2019s MovementsThat is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. In that period, the S&P 500 has returned 552.31 percent, or 7.8 percent, annualized, but to garner those handsome returns, an investor would have had to sit tight through countless downturns.While August has so far been a negative month for the stock market, there have been no major downturns this year. Through July, the S&P 500 rose for five consecutive months. Just seven big tech stocks \u2014 Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (Google) \u2014 accounted for more than two-thirds of the S&P 500\u2019s gains.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.This year, through July, the S&P 500 rose 19.5 percent, for a total return, including dividends, of 20.7 percent. Those were splendid numbers, but the market had been rising so rapidly on such a narrow base that it seemed to me that it was setting itself up for a fall.What\u2019s more, from a market bottom on Oct. 11, 2022, through July, the S&P 500 gained 27.9 percent, for a total return of 29.6 percent including dividends. In June, when the market had gained 20 percent from its October low, many commentators declared that the bear market that started on Jan. 3, 2022, was over, and that a new bull market had begun.\nMr. Silverblatt did not agree, because the market had not returned to its peak of Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 stood at 4,796.56, almost 9 percent above its current level. By his definition, it won\u2019t be clear that the S&P 500 is in a bull market until it climbs back to that level. Categorizing the market this way, as either bull or bear, is a straightforward retrospective judgment, not an assertion of the market\u2019s future direction, which no one can forecast accurately.This cautious way of thinking about the market is one I favor.I\u2019m not sure what the rally that started in October will amount to, but based on history, the summer swoon could be a good thing.The stock market\u2019s problems in August stem, at least partly, from shifts in the fixed-income markets: a sharp rise in short-term interest rates underway since the start of 2022, and a surge in long-term rates since June.The Lure of Fixed IncomeThanks to the rise in short-term rates, it\u2019s possible to get a great return on cash. Money market funds provide yields well above 5 percent.Bond yields have risen this summer, and they are now high enough to make bonds, with their safer profiles, an attractive alternative to stocks. And many factors driving up yields are negative for stocks, too.\nBriefly put, short-term rates \u2014 those embodied in money-market funds as well as credit cards \u2014 are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to reduce inflation. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy, mainly by raising the short-term rates it controls, the best known being the federal funds rate.On Friday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said that until there is conclusive evidence that inflation has been tamed, the central bank will maintain these rate levels or take them higher.Longer-term interest rates \u2014 those for bonds and mortgages \u2014 have been rising, too. But these rates are complicated. They are set in the vast bond market.By bidding down bond prices and raising yields (prices and yields move in opposite directions, as a matter of basic bond-market math), traders have indicated that they consider the economy to be stronger and inflation to be more persistent than had been expected a few months ago. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency also contributed to the run-up in rates on Treasury securities. And because Treasuries serve as benchmarks for virtually every other bond and, indeed, for every other investment in the global economy, higher rates have made stocks less appealing in comparison.In addition, the balance of supply and demand in the bond market has been tilting in a way that is contributing to higher rates. The Treasury has been auctioning an unusually large amount of debt, bulking up its resources after the brinkmanship of the debt ceiling crisis this spring. That increase in the supply of Treasuries coincides with a reduction in demand from several important sources: The Federal Reserve is no longer purchasing bonds, while the appetite for Treasuries from Japan and China has begun to flag, too.\nAll these factors have contributed to the run-up in yields, and they are weighing on stocks.Reading the EconomyFurthermore, one core issue assessed by bond buyers \u2014 the prospects for economic growth or recession in the United States and elsewhere around the world \u2014 has obsessed stock traders, too. But, at the moment, the U.S. economy is extraordinarily difficult to decipher.Higher interest rates might have been expected to slow down the economy by now, or throw it into recession. A waning of economic growth in China might also be expected to be a drag on the U.S. economy.But the U.S. economy and the job market, in particular, have been remarkably resilient, and consumer spending remains strong. As a consequence, corporate earnings in many sectors have exceeded Wall Street\u2019s muted expectations. If a recession were to develop, however, the outlook would be much worse.All that said, there are many reasons for optimism. In July, the market rally broadened substantially, with the stocks of smaller companies outperforming the giants, and every domestic sector posting gains. It was just what a stock investor would want to see in a market with sustainable upward momentum.Even the surge in interest rates could turn out to be innocuous. After all, it has returned rates to a level deemed healthy in previous economic cycles. Since January 1962, 10-year Treasury yields have averaged 4.2 percent \u2014 not far from where they are now. The appropriate level for interest rates for the rest of this decade is being debated at the Fed and among a broad range of economists.\nIn short, uncertainty about inflation and the Fed\u2019s response to it are well-founded. The paths of the markets and the economy may meander inconclusively for a while, thwarting anyone who wants to place a decisive bet one way or another.But it\u2019s a complicated world. Binary distinctions like bull market and bear market reduce complexity to simple notions that investors can grab onto. But I think these, in particular, are the wrong notions.The bull and bear market labels imply future action.In a bull market, stocks, for the most part, rise. In a bear market, more often than not, they fall. You might assume that you should avoid bear markets and welcome bull markets. But that\u2019s not a wise course for long-term investors, who are better off buying when prices are low and selling only at moments of their own choosing.I\u2019m bullish about the stock market for the long haul. But that\u2019s very different from believing that we are in a bull market or a bear right now. I just don\u2019t know and don\u2019t really care.Instead, I\u2019m investing for the long run, without trying to time market movements or pick individual stocks or bonds. I hold a piece of the world\u2019s entire stock and bond markets \u2014 not just the S&P 500 \u2014 through low-cost, broadly diversified index funds, and have been hanging in for decades.\nMarket rallies are fun, and it\u2019s a letdown when they take a breather. But an August pause could be just the thing the stock market needs. I worry about lots of things, but not that. Enjoy the rest of the summer.",

	"text": "It\u2019s awfully hard to beat the stock market consistently. In 2022, despite many advantages, most mutual funds couldn\u2019t do it. There are important lessons in that failure for this year and beyond.Recall that the S&P 500\u00a0declined 19.4 percent last year. It was a miserable\u00a0time\u00a0for just about anyone who held stocks, including\u00a0those who merely tried to match the overall market, as I do, using broadly diversified, low-cost index funds. But beneath the market\u2019s surface\u00a0last year, there were plenty of opportunities\u00a0that should have given active stock pickers a competitive advantage over index funds. That\u2019s because the average stock did better than the overall market, which was heavily influenced by a relative handful of \u201cmegacap\u201d tech stocks like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These giants declined sharply, but the rest of the market did markedly better.That meant the odds actually favored stock pickers last year. They had plenty of companies to choose from, any one of which would have given them a better performance than the overall market. And, in fact, as a group, actively managed mutual funds fared better against the overall market average than they have since 2009.\nEven so, the average actively managed stock mutual fund failed to beat the S&P 500. In an interview, Anu R. Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, summarized that mediocre performance this way. \u201cActively managed funds underperformed less badly in 2022 than they have in most years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they still underperformed.\u201dTailwinds Helped, but Not MuchIn some respects, the failure of actively managed mutual funds to beat the broad market indexes last year is unsurprising. S&P Dow Jones Indices has been running systematic comparisons of actively managed funds and passively managed funds \u2014 a.k.a. index funds \u2014 since 2001.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.These studies have consistently found that the vast majority of active fund managers just can\u2019t beat the indexes over 10- or 20-year periods, or in most individual years, either.From 2010 through 2021, anywhere from 55 percent to 87 percent of actively managed funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks couldn\u2019t beat that benchmark in any given year.Compared with that, the results for 2022 were cause for celebration: About 51 percent of large-cap stock funds failed to beat the S&P 500.\nActive managers couldn\u2019t quite achieve what random chance would predict \u2014 that 50 percent of actively managed funds would beat the index.In other words, their performance for 2022 looks slightly worse than the results of a random coin flip.That\u2019s unimpressive, but it was much worse over longer periods. Consider these tallies for funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks through the end of 2022:Over three years, 74.3 percent of actively managed funds trailed the index.Over five years, 86.5 percent underperformed.Over 10 years, 91.4 percent underperformed.Over 20 years, 94.8 percent underperformed.As the numbers show, the longer you ran the horse race, the more actively managed funds fell behind.Over 20 years through April 11, the SPDR\u00a0S&P 500 E.T.F. \u2014 one of the many mutual funds and exchange-traded index funds that track the S&P 500 \u2014 returned nearly 10 percent, annualized. The vast majority of active, stock-picking funds couldn\u2019t match that.The Odds Have Gotten WorseWhen you look carefully at the results for 2022, the performance of actively managed funds is much worse than it may seem at first glance, because it really wasn\u2019t a coin flip.\nFor the stock market, 2022 was a special year. If there was any year in which stock pickers should have been able to outperform the broad market indexes, 2022 was it, yet most still couldn\u2019t beat the battered stock market.That augurs poorly for active managers in 2023 because, so far at least, the odds have shifted.Once again, consider \u201cmegacap\u201d tech stocks, which had terrible performances last year \u2014 much worse than the S&P 500 as a whole. The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, which means that the most valuable stocks in the markets, like those from the big tech companies, have an outsize effect on stock market returns. When they decline, the overall index tends to decline. When they rise, the overall market tends to rise. Often the market moves in lock step, with many stocks heading in the same direction.But last year, the monthly \u201cdispersion\u201d of the S&P 500, which measures \u201cthe magnitude of differences\u201d in the returns of individual stocks in the index, was at its highest level since 2009. This means that there was more variation in stock returns, and most individual stocks did much better than the megacap stocks. You can see this by comparing the standard S&P 500 with an equal-weighted version, in which a stock like Dish Network, with a market capitalization of less than $5 billion, has the same weight as a colossus like Apple, with a market cap of well over $2 trillion.In 2022, the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperformed the standard index by nearly seven percentage points. That implies that if you just picked stocks randomly last year, you should have done better than the overall index because the typical random stock did better than the megacaps and better than the S&P 500. But most active managers couldn\u2019t do it.Their chances are worse this year because the market so far has been very different. Megacap stocks have been outperforming the average stock in the S&P 500 index, and the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has been trailing the standard, cap-weighted index. That implies that if you just pick stocks randomly, odds are that you will trail the overall stock market this year.\nAnd, in fact, preliminary tallies by Bank of America show that in a horse race between active large-cap\u00a0mutual fund managers and the S&P 500 this year, the active managers have been clobbered. Only 45 percent of active large-cap stock managers have matched the performance of the S&P 500. Stock pickers are doing better in some corners of the market, but for the most part, it\u2019s a dismal pictureImproving Your ChancesIt\u2019s definitely possible to beat the stock market. A small number of people will probably to do it over the next 20 years. But I don\u2019t know now who those outliers will be. Similarly, I don\u2019t know the precise direction of\u00a0the economy or of inflation or of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies or of a host of other\u00a0monumentally important factors. No one else knows, either.That\u2019s why I think it makes sense to embrace humility, accept my limitations and use low-cost index funds to try to match the returns of the stock and bond markets over the long run.To do that, and to withstand the wrenching shifts in the markets that will surely come, I\u2019ll need enough cash on hand to pay the bills first. Money-market funds and high-yield, federally insured savings accounts and certificates of deposit are reasonable options for that purpose.Make your own choice. Some active stock pickers will beat the market averages this year. But based on history, I think it\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority won\u2019t manage to do it over the next 20 years.\nBecause I\u2019m trying to improve my odds while investing for the long haul, I\u2019m aiming for an absolutely average performance.",

	"text": "Wall Street strategists are issuing forecasts for the performance of the stock market in 2024.Pay them no mind.The predictions are usually wrong, and when they\u2019re right it\u2019s only by accident.Consider their prophecies for 2023. At the end of 2022, strategists predicted that the S&P 500 would end 2023 at 4,078, a gain of 6.2 percent from where it started, according to data from Bloomberg.At the moment, the market is above 4,700, a gain of more than 22 percent. These forecasts were so deeply off the mark undoubtedly because 2022 was a truly terrible year for stocks \u2014 and also one that most analysts totally failed to foresee. So the predictions for 2023 were uncharacteristically modest, reflecting the gloom that prevailed when they were being set.The median forecast on Dec. 19 called for the S&P 500 to close 2024 at 4,750, according to Bloomberg. The projections are still shifting \u2014 and will assuredly increase if the market keeps rising. When the market rises, the forecasts typically rise, too.\nThese forecasts aren\u2019t scientific, and I only bother to address them at all because they get a tremendous amount of coverage, and they inform the advice given to thousands, and perhaps millions, of people.If you find them entertaining or otherwise illuminating \u2014 wonderful. Enjoy them.But at all costs, don\u2019t take them at face value because there is no evidence that anyone can predict the market\u2019s movements reliably, and a great deal of evidence that buying and selling stock on the basis of your views about the market\u2019s impending movements is a fool\u2019s game.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Better to invest with humility: Accept that no one knows where the market is going moment by moment, and focus on the long haul, anyway.The Big PictureOver many decades, the entire global stock market has trended upward, and as long as capitalism survives, and companies continue to profit, the stock market as a whole is likely to climb. But it certainly won\u2019t do so all the time. If you\u2019ve been in the market at all, you know that it rises and falls. These movements are, for the most part, unpredictable.Yet Wall Street strategists make predictions anyway, despite a track record that is extraordinary in its ineptitude.\nBack in 2020, using data compiled by Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, I found that since 2000 Wall Street frequently got the direction of the market wrong. At my request, Mr. Hickey has updated the data.The numbers show that from 2000 through 2023, the median Wall Street analyst forecast that the S&P 500 would rise 9 percent a year, on average. In reality, the annual increase averaged 6 percent.Even these figures understate the degree of failure.In 2018, for example, the market fell 6.9 percent, though the forecasters said it would rise 7.5 percent, a 14.4 percentage point difference. In 2002, the forecast called for an increase of 12.5 percent, but stocks fell 23.3 percent, a spread of almost 36 percentage points.And in 2022, the forecast called for an annual increase of 3.9 percent. But the stock market lost 19.4 percent. The forecasters were wrong by a margin of more than 23 percentage points.Taking gaps like these into account, the median Wall Street forecast from 2000 through 2023 missed its target by an average 13.8 percentage points annually \u2014 more than double the actual average annual performance of the stock market.\nThe Situation NowMany Wall Street strategists are astute analysts of what has already happened. But the economy and the markets shift constantly, in unexpected ways. Reliably forecasting stock market averages 12 months in advance is beyond anybody\u2019s ability.Declining inflation combined with a robust labor market has led many people to believe that the Federal Reserve will soon be cutting the short-term interest rates that it controls directly. This is seen as bullish for the stock market, which has risen in the past couple of months. The S&P 500 is on the verge of surpassing its last peak, reached in January. And if there is no recession in the next year, and interest rates do decline, it\u2019s reasonable to think that the market will keep rising.That, in a nutshell, is the bullish case. But it\u2019s easy to conjure up bearish alternatives, too.For example, if the Fed cuts interest rates prematurely, inflation could surge. The central bank may then need to raise interest rates again, as Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chair, had to do in 1981, setting off a second recession in two years.A \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy in 2024 could be coming. But so could a recession.David Rosenberg, a veteran strategist and economist, is still predicting one, as he has since early 2022. He expects the economy to falter, interest rates to plummet and stocks to fall. \u201cTreasury bonds, not the stock market, will be the best performing asset class in 2024,\u201d he told me in an interview.Given the complexity of the world and all of the crises, big and small, that are already obvious, it would take a very long column to sketch out all of the things that could go wrong with a forecast about the next year. And I\u2019m certain that there will be major shifts that few people yet imagine.\nFortunately, you don\u2019t have to know these things to be a successful investor.The key, first of all, is to have enough money set aside to pay the bills, because investment involves some risk, and you don\u2019t want to take risks with money you absolutely need. Then, to minimize your risks while holding stocks, resolve to invest in the entire market for decades through low-cost diversified index funds, and avoid any attempt at timing the market. Wall Street predictions might tempt you to buy and sell at the wrong times. It\u2019s safer to ignore these forecasts entirely.Stocks are just part of the program. I also invest in high-quality bonds and do so the same way, with broad, low-cost index funds. Investment-grade bonds, and especially Treasuries, usually provide a buffer when stocks fall (though they didn\u2019t do so in 2022). Treasuries, in particular, are safe investments, despite the fiscal strains resulting from the failure of the U.S. government in recent years to reach consensus on spending and taxation policies.I find these forecasting exercises fascinating, and sometimes learn a great deal from them, but I don\u2019t expect any of them to provide a road map to the future.Hope for the best, prepare for the worst and get on with life. Unfortunately, Wall Street forecasts won\u2019t help with any of that.",

	"text": "Wall Street\u2019s worries eased on Tuesday, as investors took comfort from signs that a potential banking crisis appeared contained and bet on a more supportive environment for the economy going forward.The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent, lifted by a recovery in some bank stocks and bolstered by gains for heavyweights like Microsoft and Apple, which because of their size have a bigger impact on the performance of the broader index. More than three-quarters of the stocks in the index rose on Tuesday.It\u2019s common for stocks to bounce after a substantial fall, as investors try to gauge where markets will shake out once a period of stress passes. Nonetheless, the lift in the market was a welcome reprieve for investors who have been battered by a rapidly shifting economic backdrop that has led to whipsaw moves across stock and bond markets.One dominant narrative taking shape posits that the crisis in the banking sector may lead to a more supportive environment for markets. The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank appears contained, and the episode may also give the Federal Reserve reason to forgo further interest rate increases. Higher interest rates raise costs for companies and were at the root of the stress in the banking sector, so fewer rate increases could help stocks to rebound.\n\u201cThis is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cAbsent further deterioration in regional banks, I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Fresh inflation data on Tuesday appeared to show just enough cooling to support the case for a more restrained Fed. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation slowing slightly for the year through February, despite accelerating from the previous month.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Investors\u2019 bets on whether the Fed will raise interest rates when it meets next week tilted back to expecting a quarter-point increase, after briefly flirting with no change, still markedly lower than where expectations stood a week ago. Investors now expect the central bank to raise interest rates to a peak of around 4.9 percent, down sharply from around 5.5 percent last week. That implies an expectation of one more quarter-point increase to come, down from as many as four such increases a week ago.In the bond market, sentiment appeared less hopeful. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, rose by more than 0.2 percentage points \u2014 a big move for an asset that usually moves in tiny fractions of a percentage point. Tuesday\u2019s rise followed a deep fall on Monday that echoed painful flash points such as the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Though the yield on the 10-year Treasury note still rose, it remained more anchored, suggesting fading hopes for economic growth over the long term.\n\u201cI think what is reflected in the bond market is an elevated risk of recession and a credit crunch, but for whatever reason it hasn\u2019t reached stock investors yet,\u201d Ms. Sonders said.That dissonance makes predicting the path forward even harder, with some investors warning that financial markets could be headed for more days of volatile trading as investors make sense of the murky outlook.\u201cPeople are trying to gauge what the Fed is actually going to do given all the new information since the end of last week,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. \u201cI think there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The Fed really has a dilemma on its hands here.\u201d",

	"text": "Investors swiftly reshuffled their portfolios this week, as they absorbed the Federal Reserve\u2019s signals and prepared for the effects of higher interest rates for longer than they had previously thought.Stock prices slumped, the dollar soared and bond yields crept higher after the Fed meeting on Wednesday: Despite holding rates steady, a shift in Fed policymakers\u2019 predictions about how long they expected to hold interest rates at high levels prompted a sharp reassessment on Wall Street.The S&P 500 index slumped lower for the third consecutive week, despite paring some of its losses on Friday with a modest gain. It ended the week down close to 3 percent, its worst weekly performance since March, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.The yields on longer-dated bonds, which serve as a gauge of the cost of corporate borrowing and can weigh on stock prices, rose to levels last seen in the buildup to the 2008 financial crisis. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly moved above 4.5 percent, its highest since September 2007, up roughly half a percentage point so far this month, a sizable move in that market.\nInvestors yanked nearly $18 billion from stock markets in the United States in the week through Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global, the most in a week since late 2022, and that was before the Fed\u2019s announcements pushed yields even higher.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The stock market\u2019s rate-sensitive areas, such as technology stocks, have been particularly hard hit. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6 percent for the week.\u201cInvestors appear concerned that keeping rates higher for longer will weigh on equity valuations and make it harder for the Fed to achieve a soft economic landing,\u201d Keith Lerner of Truist said in a research note on Friday.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Fed officials now predict that interest rates will end next year at 5.1 percent, according to the median projection by policymakers, markedly higher than their 4.6 percent forecast in June.The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and many economists have expressed hope that the economy can remain resilient despite the squeeze from higher interest rates. Higher interest rates are still making their way through the economy, confronting consumers when they refinance mortgages or take out new loans, and hitting companies when they roll over debt fixed when interest rates were much lower.\nIt\u2019s partly because the economy has held up so well that the Fed expects to have to do more to try and slow it down in order to tame stubborn inflation, while trying to avoid tipping it into recession. That economic resilience should mean that the stock market \u201ccan handle higher bond yields better,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank noted.The stock market remains about 13 percent up from the start of the year, despite sharply higher interest rates. But investors are wary of putting too much confidence in predictions for the path of rates in the future.In January, trading in financial markets implied that the Fed would be cutting rates as soon as this month. Now, investors expect rate cuts to begin in the second half of next year.\u201cForecasting is very difficult,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cForecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.\u201dIn the next few months, investors must contend with the autoworkers\u2019 strike, the restart of student loan repayments and the threat of a government shutdown.\u201cThere is a lack of upside catalyst in the near term to get more bullish about,\u201d Mr. Lerner of Truist said.",

	"text": "The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday had a glitch that led to wild price swings that affected over 250 stocks, including shares of large companies like Wells Fargo, Verizon and Nike.Shares of Nike fell more than 12 percent immediately after trading began at 9:30 a.m. in New York. In less than a second, Verizon swung between a loss of over 17 percent and a gain of nearly 13 percent, while Wells Fargo plummeted more than 15 percent.The moves, which added or wiped out billions of dollars of market value, led the exchange to halt trading in just over 80 different shares. Stock exchanges have built-in \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d that automatically pause trading if a stock price suddenly swings by a large amount.Once trading resumed, the companies\u2019 share prices moved more or less in line with a typical trading day. Shares of Nike, Verizon and Wells Fargo, for example, had gained or lost less than 2 percent by the end of trading on Tuesday.\nThe explanation for the turmoil, the exchange said, was a malfunction in its system at a crucial time for the financial markets. Typically, the N.Y.S.E. holds an opening auction at the start of trading day, collecting orders from buyers and sellers to set the opening price of individual stocks. The exchange said that for some stocks \u201copening auctions did not occur,\u201d resulting in the market mayhem.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The whipsaw trading meant some investors will have paid much more to buy shares than the prevailing market price, while others paid much less. Some investors said their trades simply weren\u2019t executed, with significantly reduced trading volumes. Traders said they expected much of the activity to be reversed.\u201cSomebody is having an unhappy day,\u201d said Edward Monrad, head of market structure at Optiver, a so-called market maker, which is a type of business expected to buy and sell shares to facilitate trading. \u201cThose trades will most likely get busted, which means people are sitting on trades that they are uncertain exist.\u201dBy the afternoon, the N.Y.S.E. said its member firms could flag erroneous trades or request compensation for losses arising from Tuesday\u2019s events, in accordance with its rules. The exchange later said some trades in over 250 stocks would automatically be declared \u201cnull and void.\u201dSome investors had earlier raised concerns about the extent of the price moves, before circuit breakers were set off. Exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. use what are known as \u201climit up, limit down\u201d triggers to stop trading in a stock if its price moves too much, too quickly.\nAt the open, this is typically set at 5 percent or 10 percent above and below the stock\u2019s opening price. These triggers are designed to protect investors from sharp moves, allowing markets a moment to pause and reset prices before they spiral out of control.Trade data shows, however, that some transactions were executed outside these ranges.The tobacco company Altria ended Monday at a price of $44.81. It opened on Tuesday up over 15 percent at $51.57, which appeared to set the stock\u2019s lower trading limit 5 percent lower at $48.99. Yet within milliseconds trades were executed around $47, $38, $42, $45 and $44 before the price jumped back to $48.99, according to reported trade data.Some of these trades were among those the N.Y.S.E. said it would reverse.Reversing trades, though, could create further problems for investors who were unsure if they had bought or sold stock, or not. This could also knock on to trades conducted on other exchanges affected by the volatility on the N.Y.S.E.",

	"text": "A group of regional bank stocks that came under severe pressure this week, stoking fears of a spiraling banking crisis, surged on Friday, at least partly alleviating those worries.The rebound came as the market was also bolstered by data on hiring that was deemed strong enough to soften concerns about a recession without prompting the Federal Reserve to tighten the screws on the economy further.PacWest soared over 80 percent, after falling over 50 percent on Thursday. Western Alliance\u2019s share price rose almost 50 percent, also recouping a chunk of its drop the day before.The relief rally helped to lift the broader market, with the S&P 500 up 1.9 percent, its first day of gains in May.\n\u201cWe thought the banks were unfairly punished over the past week, and even before that,\u201d said Matt Peron, the director of research at Janus Henderson, an asset manager. \u201cThe rally makes sense because they were oversold.\u201dThe State of Jobs in the United StatesToo Few Workers: Employers in Vermont are battling a labor shortage as the local population grows older. The state\u2019s struggles offer an early look at where the rest of the country could be headed.Seasonal Hiring: After scrambling to fill out work forces the last few holiday seasons, many retailers are reporting more modest goals for temporary employment this year.Truck Drivers: The trucking industry has complained for years about a dire shortage of drivers. But some women say many companies have made it effectively impossible for them to get those jobs.A Surge in Start-ups: The Covid-19 pandemic hurt the U.S. economy in a lot of ways. But it might have also broken America out of a decades-long entrepreneurial slump.Still, the gains weren\u2019t enough to reverse another bruising week for the nation\u2019s midsize banks. The seizure and sale of First Republic to JPMorgan Chase on Monday was presented by Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, ushering in the end of the crisis that began in March with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.However, Mr. Dimon added that there \u201cmay be another smaller\u201d bank to run into trouble. Shortly thereafter, a fresh bout of pressure clobbered the stocks of smaller lenders like PacWest and Western Alliance, which tried to reassure investors that their deposit bases were stable and that the market moves were unrelated to their financial health.Even with Friday\u2019s bounce, PacWest remained set to end the week having lost nearly half its market value. Western Alliance ended roughly a quarter below where it started the week. The S&P 500 ended the week 0.8 percent lower.After trading ended on Friday, the Federal Reserve released data showing that deposits at commercial banks in the United States declined slightly in the week that ended April 26, falling to $17.17 trillion from $17.18 trillion in the week before. At domestically chartered banks, though, they ticked higher \u2014 to $15.96 trillion from $15.94 trillion previously. In either case, the data showed deposits had stabilized following much more sizable declines in March and early April.\nConcern over the fate of the regional lenders was further relieved by fresh data on Friday that showed a robust labor market, with the pace of new hiring in April coming in stronger than expected and workers still achieving elevated wage gains.Despite the strong numbers for April, downward revisions to data from earlier months show the longer-term trend of a slowing labor market persisted, and investors still expect Fed policymakers to pause on raising interest rates when they next meet in June.Elsewhere, oil prices rose, often a reflection of a brighter outlook for the global economy. They, too, bounced higher following a sharp decline earlier in the week.A further tailwind for the market came from Apple, which reported better-than-expected profits for the first quarter, helping push its share price nearly 5 percent higher on Friday. Because of the size of the tech behemoth, its moves have more of an effect on the S&P 500 than any company in the index.Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has said that it is possible to slow the economy enough to stem inflation without tipping it into recession. Arguably, Friday\u2019s employment data supports that notion of a so-called soft landing.\nNonetheless, some investors remain on edge, even after Friday\u2019s bounce. The strong data nudged higher the possibility of a rate increase in June.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changing interest-rate expectations, also rose, climbing 0.16 percentage points to 3.9 percent \u2014 a big move for an asset that typically changes by hundredths of a percentage point each day, and a sign that investors think interest rates could stay higher for longer.\u201cThe market seems vulnerable to a shock,\u201d said Mr. Peron. \u201cWe are going to be cautious until we get through a pause.\u201dJeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

Shares are still down by roughly two-thirds over the past five trading days.Western Alliance, previously a little-known Arizona bank, saw its stock shoot up 50 percent on Tuesday after Citadel, the investment giant run by the billionaire Ken Griffin, disclosed that it had taken a stake in the hard-hit lender, though that gain was pared back to 14 percent by the end of the day.Some of the worst-hit banks seemed to go to extreme lengths to put on a brave face, and they had some success doing so. Zions Bank of Salt Lake City convened an emergency forum featuring both senators from Utah. Its stock bounced back to a degree on Tuesday, as did shares of PacWest Bancorp of Los Angeles and Charles Schwab, the Texas financial conglomerate.\nThough the financial world was suddenly glued to news of banks that only the most obsessive observers would have earlier heard of, none of their chief executives would agree to be interviewed. Some sent out mass notes to customers that side stepped the most pressing questions of the moment: How much money was being withdrawn this week, and what was the plan if the outflows pressed on?One bank chief executive, Brad Tidwell of VeraBank, shared his personal cellphone number to all 70,000 depositors at his institution, which has roughly $4 billion in deposits. His phone lit up Monday and Tuesday with more than 50 text messages and around two dozen phone calls from customers, asking him for personal assurances that everything would turn out OK.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Some callers told him that with so many institutions sending out emails crammed with legal jargon to explain their financial positions, they just wanted a straight answer from him: Was their money safe, or not?\u201cI\u2019ve been telling everyone, \u2018When banks fail it\u2019s a big deal, but that doesn\u2019t mean your bank has the same issues,\u2019\u201d Mr. Tidwell said.\nWhile stock prices aren\u2019t a clear proxy for whether a bank is healthy or not, falling shares or even simply volatility in prices can set off panic in borrowers and lead to a bank run. The recent downturn in the industry, in fact, was set off in part by just that, when shares in Silicon Valley Bank, a technology-focused lender, plummeted after it disclosed plans to raise money that it needed to pay out some depositors.\nLess than two days later, Silicon Valley Bank, which had roughly $175 billion in deposits, was taken over by federal regulators, making it the biggest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. Shares in other relatively small institutions have since fallen precipitously on fears that they, too, could be insolvent, though thus far only one other bank, Signature Bank, has been seized by regulators.On Sunday, federal officials committed to paying out depositors at those fallen banks in full, even if the banks did not have sufficient money. Depositors reported Monday that they were able to take out funds, an enormous relief to employers and individuals who had been worried about when and if they would regain access to their money.Officials stressed, however, that stock and bond holders in the banks themselves would still be in line to lose money on their investments.Investors seem to be assuming that the federal backstop applied to Silicon Valley Bank and Signature would also apply to other institutions, said Greg Hertrich, a U.S. bank strategist at Nomura and a bank executive for more than three decades.\n\u201cHaving been through a bunch of these, I can say: This one\u2019s moving fast,\u201d Mr. Hertrich said. \u201cThere are people who seem to believe that every deposit account is guaranteed without limit. I have not seen any indication that is what regulators have expressed.\u201d\nFor the first day since Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s unwinding, there were no widespread reports of customers being denied the chance to withdraw money from ATMs and bank branches. It appeared that the worst fears of widespread cash shortages were contained for now.Yet much uncertainty remains. As bank shares were recovering and branches returned to normalcy on Tuesday, only a few institutions had provided extensive updates about the degree to which skittish customers were pulling out their money.On Monday, First Republic\u2019s executive chairman, Jim Herbert, told CNBC in an off-camera interview that the bank was not experiencing an unusual level of withdrawals, a pronouncement that the anchors on the set greeted with visible skepticism. The bank did not respond to inquiries from The New York Times about the statement.\nCharles Schwab\u2019s chief executive, Walter Bettinger, boasted in a CNBC interview on Tuesday that his firm had seen positive incoming deposits this month overall, but neither he nor a Schwab spokeswoman would provide figures for this week, when Schwab\u2019s stock has been under the most acute pressure. Mr. Bettinger said he had bought roughly $3 million in new shares Tuesday to show his faith in the company.Zions, whose ties to the Mormon Church stretch back to the bank\u2019s first president, Brigham Young, has been similarly vague. On Monday, the company held a forum with high-profile political guests, including not just both senators but the governor as well. Scott Anderson, the bank\u2019s chief executive, opened by reading a script that noted Zions had a more diversified business base than Silicon Valley Bank, but he did not take questions or provide new information about his organization\u2019s financial base during the crisis.Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who was at the event, compared the situation to the film \u201cEverything, Everywhere All at Once,\u201d which won seven Academy Awards the night before. \u201cThis is a lot of stuff that happened at the same time,\u201d Mr. Romney said.Mr. Tidwell, the bank chief executive who shared his cellphone number, said he was watching stock prices of his larger rivals get whiplash.\u201cI\u2019ve been in this business long enough to know that we are one news cycle away from the angst getting even worse.\u201d",

	"text": "The unexpected seizure of two banks in three days by regulators intensified fears of a broader financial crisis, sending the stocks of more than two dozen banks into free fall on Monday, even as President Biden reassured Americans that the banking system was resilient and that customers\u2019 money was safe.Banks of various sizes in different parts of the country \u2014 from San Francisco-based First Republic Bank to Salt Lake City-based Zions Bank \u2014 found themselves battling market turmoil as customers rushed to withdraw their deposits and investors, worried about more runs, dumped bank stocks.In a brief televised statement from the White House shortly before the U.S. markets opened, Mr. Biden said that the government was responding decisively to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank in ways that would protect depositors without rewarding risk-taking executives and investors.\u201cAmericans can rest assured that our banking system is safe \u2014 your deposits are safe,\u201d the president said. \u201cLet me also assure you we will not stop at this; we\u2019ll do whatever is needed.\u201d\nMr. Biden\u2019s comments didn\u2019t immediately appear to assuage investors, as shares of banks large and small closed the day in the red, with the KBW Bank Index, a proxy for the industry, down nearly 12 percent. On a day when the S&P 500 stock index ended up flat, shares of First Republic tumbled 60 percent and Western Alliance slumped 45 percent.Despite the echoes of the 2008 financial crisis, when 465 banks failed within four years, sometimes dozens in a month, regulators and banking officials were quick to insist that the current panic is far more contained, and that the banks whose stocks tanked had enough funds to meet their obligations.Last week, Silvergate, a cryptocurrency focused bank, said it would shut down; between Friday and Sunday, the government seized Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.On Monday, the Federal Reserve announced that it would conduct a review of Silicon Valley Bank\u2019s oversight. The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, on whose board the former chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank, Gregory Becker, sat until Friday, was responsible for supervising the failed bank.\u201cThe events surrounding Silicon Valley Bank demand a thorough, transparent and swift review by the Federal Reserve,\u201d Jerome H. Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in a release.\nRegulators decided to shut down Signature Bank after it \u201cfailed to provide reliable data and created a lack of confidence in the bank\u2019s leadership,\u201d said Adrienne A. Harris, New York State\u2019s superintendent of financial services.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cEveryone is breathing hard today, and maybe I\u2019m missing it, but I think everything should settle down,\u201d Lloyd Blankfein, who was the chief executive of Goldman Sachs during the 2008 financial crisis, said in an interview.It was hard to tell whether shareholders were reacting to actual vulnerabilities they spotted in the financials of those companies, or to the possibility that they would meet the same fate as Silicon Valley and Signature. Neither was there an obvious reason for why companies as large as Charles Schwab, with roughly $350 billion in deposits, and as small as Western Alliance, with $62 billion in deposits, got caught in the cross hairs. Silicon Valley Bank had roughly $175 billion in deposits before last week, and Signature had under $100 billion before it was shut down.\u201cSchwab has gotten a lot bigger, and the question is: Did they make the same mistakes SVB did?\u201d asked Robert Siegel, a business school lecturer at Stanford.Schwab released a statement Monday saying it was \u201cwell positioned to navigate the current environment,\u201d and called itself \u201ca safe port in a storm.\u201d\nAnticipating a blood bath on Monday, First Republic, the nation\u2019s 14th largest bank, said a day earlier that it could grab $70 billion if needed from sources including the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase, the nation\u2019s largest bank by assets. Its shares still lost nearly three-fifths of their value on Monday \u2014 at one point touching $30, a low they had not touched since the end of 2010.\nPacWest Bancorp, a Los Angeles bank that lends to small and medium-sized businesses, also sought to quell concerns about its stability, emphasizing on Monday that it had access to $14 billion in funds through a mix of cash, easily sellable securities, a credit line from the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and access to the Federal Reserve\u2019s discount window, a borrowing program that provides fast liquidity.The bank said in a regulatory filing on Monday that its customers had withdrawn some $700 million in deposits as of late last week, leaving PacWest with $33.2 billion in deposits and $41 billion in assets. Shares of PacWest plunged nearly 60 percent before recovering to end the day at $9.75, down 21 percent from Friday\u2019s closing.\u201cBank stock investors don\u2019t like uncertainty, and there\u2019s a lot of that right now,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays. \u201cYou have to be concerned that the lack of stock market confidence leads to a lack of depositor confidence.\u201d\nEven if a bank\u2019s stock price is not directly correlated to the strength of its balance sheet, Mr. Goldberg said, investors and depositors often end up using market performance as an indicator of financial health. So a loss of depositor confidence could mean a rush of withdrawals, which could drag down a bank.\u201cHopefully, all the regionals get through the day, aided by this new Fed facility,\u201d Mr. Goldberg said, referring to the central bank\u2019s emergency program offering banks favorable one-year loans in return for collateral, \u201cand tomorrow, cooler heads prevail.\u201dRegional banks \u2014 and even some banks with a national presence \u2014 lack the name recognition of banking Goliaths like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. Yet, they play a vital role in supporting local businesses nationwide, like law firms, real estate developers, veterinarians\u2019 offices, retail shops and restaurants. Many banks also provide wealth management and private banking services, and they serve as the primary bank for individual savers.Zions, a Salt Lake City bank whose stock plummeted on Monday, was a large loan provider when the Small Business Administration started its Paycheck Protection Program in 2020 to help local businesses struggling to survive during the pandemic.\nOn Monday afternoon, executives of Zions held a private briefing for analysts to assuage concerns that they could be the next to fall. The bank turned down their requests to provide a formal update on whether depositors were pulling their cash, according to a bank executive who was not authorized to speak publicly.\nSmaller banks are especially vulnerable to financial panic, including those institutions that focus on certain groups of customers. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Friday, followed by the federal government\u2019s closure of Signature Bank on Sunday, highlighted that.Silicon Valley catered mainly to the technology start-up community, and Signature Bank was a big lender to New York\u2019s legal and real estate industries. So even if their troubles didn\u2019t pose a widespread systemic risk, the two banks were central enough to those industries that bank runs would be extremely destabilizing, said Tyler Gellasch, president of Healthy Markets Association, an advocate for greater transparency in financial markets.\u201cIf Signature happened in a vacuum, we probably don\u2019t see this regulatory action,\u201d Mr. Gellasch said. \u201cOn each coast, we have bank failures that are uniquely focused on very wealthy and very connected industries.\u201dIt didn\u2019t help that Signature Bank also made a big play for cryptocurrency deposits \u2014 an area that many big banks were wary of entering, or prevented from doing so by stringent regulation. When the crypto bubble burst, the value of billions of dollars of customer deposits fell, leaving Signature on perilous ground.\nAt various banks, depositors \u2014 especially those with business accounts that hold more than $250,000 \u2014 were also concerned that they would lose much of their money because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures deposits of up to $250,000. On Sunday, the F.D.I.C. said that all customers of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank with deposits above $250,000 would be made whole.Jamie Dupree, a San Francisco lawyer with accounts in the seven-figure range at First Republic, said she spent hours consulting with her banker there about how to proceed. Though Ms. Dupree was loath to contribute to panic, she felt she had no choice but to transfer some of her money to a larger institution.\u201cPersonally, I did not want to be part of a run, but I also didn\u2019t want to be economically vulnerable,\u201d said Ms. Dupree, who moved part of her money.\nMidsize banks like First Republic and PacWest sit between the handful of household-name banks with assets of $1 trillion or more, and tiny community banks that serve neighborhood businesses and customers. They play a crucial role in supplying businesses of a certain size with loans to grow.\nWhen Will York, the owner of Thunder Road Guitars PDX in Portland, Ore., wanted to buy a building for his growing guitar shop, his sales agent steered him toward regional lenders rather than Wells Fargo, where he had been a customer for decades. Bigger banks had little interest in the $1.1 million loan he needed \u2014 puny by their standards, but enormous by his.\u201cThe person from PacWest came in and spoke to me like I wasn\u2019t an idiot,\u201d Mr. York, 36, said. Even better, the bank put together a financing package, using a combination of its own money and a government loan backed by the Small Business Administration, to cover the entire cost of the 3,200-square-foot building Mr. York closed on in late 2021.\u201cOwning a building has been a goal of mine since even before I opened my store,\u201d he said. \u201cI absolutely could not have done it without PacWest.\u201dMatthew Goldstein Peter Baker and Joe Rennison contributed to this report.",

	"text": "The stock market\u2019s monthslong rally stumbled this month. The thrill of seeing investment gains, with metronomic regularity, is gone.I miss that feeling: scanning my investments and knowing in advance that the numbers will be larger than they were the last time I looked. But, in an important way, the market\u2019s summer setbacks have been long awaited, and they come as something of a relief.Don\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not that I want to see the rising stock market stop in its tracks. I\u2019d prefer an endless move upward, making me, and everyone else, richer.But that\u2019s a fantasy. In the real world, upward stock market thrusts are always temporary. When stocks rise too quickly, they inevitably fall and sometimes crash. The stock market is essentially volatile, and for every big winner, dozens of casualties occur. \nThat\u2019s why, as a second-best alternative, I hope for something more modest: a choppy market that experiences periodic downturns, but one that trends upward for very long periods.The Stock Market\u2019s MovementsThat is, in fact, a rough description of what the stock market has been like for the past 25 years, according to statistics provided by Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices. In that period, the S&P 500 has returned 552.31 percent, or 7.8 percent, annualized, but to garner those handsome returns, an investor would have had to sit tight through countless downturns.While August has so far been a negative month for the stock market, there have been no major downturns this year. Through July, the S&P 500 rose for five consecutive months. Just seven big tech stocks \u2014 Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Tesla and Alphabet (Google) \u2014 accounted for more than two-thirds of the S&P 500\u2019s gains.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.This year, through July, the S&P 500 rose 19.5 percent, for a total return, including dividends, of 20.7 percent. Those were splendid numbers, but the market had been rising so rapidly on such a narrow base that it seemed to me that it was setting itself up for a fall.What\u2019s more, from a market bottom on Oct. 11, 2022, through July, the S&P 500 gained 27.9 percent, for a total return of 29.6 percent including dividends. In June, when the market had gained 20 percent from its October low, many commentators declared that the bear market that started on Jan. 3, 2022, was over, and that a new bull market had begun.\nMr. Silverblatt did not agree, because the market had not returned to its peak of Jan. 3, 2022, when the S&P 500 stood at 4,796.56, almost 9 percent above its current level. By his definition, it won\u2019t be clear that the S&P 500 is in a bull market until it climbs back to that level. Categorizing the market this way, as either bull or bear, is a straightforward retrospective judgment, not an assertion of the market\u2019s future direction, which no one can forecast accurately.This cautious way of thinking about the market is one I favor.I\u2019m not sure what the rally that started in October will amount to, but based on history, the summer swoon could be a good thing.The stock market\u2019s problems in August stem, at least partly, from shifts in the fixed-income markets: a sharp rise in short-term interest rates underway since the start of 2022, and a surge in long-term rates since June.The Lure of Fixed IncomeThanks to the rise in short-term rates, it\u2019s possible to get a great return on cash. Money market funds provide yields well above 5 percent.Bond yields have risen this summer, and they are now high enough to make bonds, with their safer profiles, an attractive alternative to stocks. And many factors driving up yields are negative for stocks, too.\nBriefly put, short-term rates \u2014 those embodied in money-market funds as well as credit cards \u2014 are a direct consequence of the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign to reduce inflation. The Fed has been tightening monetary policy, mainly by raising the short-term rates it controls, the best known being the federal funds rate.On Friday, Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, said that until there is conclusive evidence that inflation has been tamed, the central bank will maintain these rate levels or take them higher.Longer-term interest rates \u2014 those for bonds and mortgages \u2014 have been rising, too. But these rates are complicated. They are set in the vast bond market.By bidding down bond prices and raising yields (prices and yields move in opposite directions, as a matter of basic bond-market math), traders have indicated that they consider the economy to be stronger and inflation to be more persistent than had been expected a few months ago. The downgrade of U.S. Treasury debt by the Fitch Ratings agency also contributed to the run-up in rates on Treasury securities. And because Treasuries serve as benchmarks for virtually every other bond and, indeed, for every other investment in the global economy, higher rates have made stocks less appealing in comparison.In addition, the balance of supply and demand in the bond market has been tilting in a way that is contributing to higher rates. The Treasury has been auctioning an unusually large amount of debt, bulking up its resources after the brinkmanship of the debt ceiling crisis this spring. That increase in the supply of Treasuries coincides with a reduction in demand from several important sources: The Federal Reserve is no longer purchasing bonds, while the appetite for Treasuries from Japan and China has begun to flag, too.\nAll these factors have contributed to the run-up in yields, and they are weighing on stocks.Reading the EconomyFurthermore, one core issue assessed by bond buyers \u2014 the prospects for economic growth or recession in the United States and elsewhere around the world \u2014 has obsessed stock traders, too. But, at the moment, the U.S. economy is extraordinarily difficult to decipher.Higher interest rates might have been expected to slow down the economy by now, or throw it into recession. A waning of economic growth in China might also be expected to be a drag on the U.S. economy.But the U.S. economy and the job market, in particular, have been remarkably resilient, and consumer spending remains strong. As a consequence, corporate earnings in many sectors have exceeded Wall Street\u2019s muted expectations. If a recession were to develop, however, the outlook would be much worse.All that said, there are many reasons for optimism. In July, the market rally broadened substantially, with the stocks of smaller companies outperforming the giants, and every domestic sector posting gains. It was just what a stock investor would want to see in a market with sustainable upward momentum.Even the surge in interest rates could turn out to be innocuous. After all, it has returned rates to a level deemed healthy in previous economic cycles. Since January 1962, 10-year Treasury yields have averaged 4.2 percent \u2014 not far from where they are now. The appropriate level for interest rates for the rest of this decade is being debated at the Fed and among a broad range of economists.\nIn short, uncertainty about inflation and the Fed\u2019s response to it are well-founded. The paths of the markets and the economy may meander inconclusively for a while, thwarting anyone who wants to place a decisive bet one way or another.But it\u2019s a complicated world. Binary distinctions like bull market and bear market reduce complexity to simple notions that investors can grab onto. But I think these, in particular, are the wrong notions.The bull and bear market labels imply future action.In a bull market, stocks, for the most part, rise. In a bear market, more often than not, they fall. You might assume that you should avoid bear markets and welcome bull markets. But that\u2019s not a wise course for long-term investors, who are better off buying when prices are low and selling only at moments of their own choosing.I\u2019m bullish about the stock market for the long haul. But that\u2019s very different from believing that we are in a bull market or a bear right now. I just don\u2019t know and don\u2019t really care.Instead, I\u2019m investing for the long run, without trying to time market movements or pick individual stocks or bonds. I hold a piece of the world\u2019s entire stock and bond markets \u2014 not just the S&P 500 \u2014 through low-cost, broadly diversified index funds, and have been hanging in for decades.\nMarket rallies are fun, and it\u2019s a letdown when they take a breather. But an August pause could be just the thing the stock market needs. I worry about lots of things, but not that. Enjoy the rest of the summer.",

	"text": "It\u2019s awfully hard to beat the stock market consistently. In 2022, despite many advantages, most mutual funds couldn\u2019t do it. There are important lessons in that failure for this year and beyond.Recall that the S&P 500\u00a0declined 19.4 percent last year. It was a miserable\u00a0time\u00a0for just about anyone who held stocks, including\u00a0those who merely tried to match the overall market, as I do, using broadly diversified, low-cost index funds. But beneath the market\u2019s surface\u00a0last year, there were plenty of opportunities\u00a0that should have given active stock pickers a competitive advantage over index funds. That\u2019s because the average stock did better than the overall market, which was heavily influenced by a relative handful of \u201cmegacap\u201d tech stocks like Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. These giants declined sharply, but the rest of the market did markedly better.That meant the odds actually favored stock pickers last year. They had plenty of companies to choose from, any one of which would have given them a better performance than the overall market. And, in fact, as a group, actively managed mutual funds fared better against the overall market average than they have since 2009.\nEven so, the average actively managed stock mutual fund failed to beat the S&P 500. In an interview, Anu R. Ganti, senior director of index investment strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices, summarized that mediocre performance this way. \u201cActively managed funds underperformed less badly in 2022 than they have in most years,\u201d she said. \u201cBut they still underperformed.\u201dTailwinds Helped, but Not MuchIn some respects, the failure of actively managed mutual funds to beat the broad market indexes last year is unsurprising. S&P Dow Jones Indices has been running systematic comparisons of actively managed funds and passively managed funds \u2014 a.k.a. index funds \u2014 since 2001.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.These studies have consistently found that the vast majority of active fund managers just can\u2019t beat the indexes over 10- or 20-year periods, or in most individual years, either.From 2010 through 2021, anywhere from 55 percent to 87 percent of actively managed funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks couldn\u2019t beat that benchmark in any given year.Compared with that, the results for 2022 were cause for celebration: About 51 percent of large-cap stock funds failed to beat the S&P 500.\nActive managers couldn\u2019t quite achieve what random chance would predict \u2014 that 50 percent of actively managed funds would beat the index.In other words, their performance for 2022 looks slightly worse than the results of a random coin flip.That\u2019s unimpressive, but it was much worse over longer periods. Consider these tallies for funds that invest in S&P 500 stocks through the end of 2022:Over three years, 74.3 percent of actively managed funds trailed the index.Over five years, 86.5 percent underperformed.Over 10 years, 91.4 percent underperformed.Over 20 years, 94.8 percent underperformed.As the numbers show, the longer you ran the horse race, the more actively managed funds fell behind.Over 20 years through April 11, the SPDR\u00a0S&P 500 E.T.F. \u2014 one of the many mutual funds and exchange-traded index funds that track the S&P 500 \u2014 returned nearly 10 percent, annualized. The vast majority of active, stock-picking funds couldn\u2019t match that.The Odds Have Gotten WorseWhen you look carefully at the results for 2022, the performance of actively managed funds is much worse than it may seem at first glance, because it really wasn\u2019t a coin flip.\nFor the stock market, 2022 was a special year. If there was any year in which stock pickers should have been able to outperform the broad market indexes, 2022 was it, yet most still couldn\u2019t beat the battered stock market.That augurs poorly for active managers in 2023 because, so far at least, the odds have shifted.Once again, consider \u201cmegacap\u201d tech stocks, which had terrible performances last year \u2014 much worse than the S&P 500 as a whole. The S&P 500 is a capitalization-weighted index, which means that the most valuable stocks in the markets, like those from the big tech companies, have an outsize effect on stock market returns. When they decline, the overall index tends to decline. When they rise, the overall market tends to rise. Often the market moves in lock step, with many stocks heading in the same direction.But last year, the monthly \u201cdispersion\u201d of the S&P 500, which measures \u201cthe magnitude of differences\u201d in the returns of individual stocks in the index, was at its highest level since 2009. This means that there was more variation in stock returns, and most individual stocks did much better than the megacap stocks. You can see this by comparing the standard S&P 500 with an equal-weighted version, in which a stock like Dish Network, with a market capitalization of less than $5 billion, has the same weight as a colossus like Apple, with a market cap of well over $2 trillion.In 2022, the equal-weighted S&P 500 outperformed the standard index by nearly seven percentage points. That implies that if you just picked stocks randomly last year, you should have done better than the overall index because the typical random stock did better than the megacaps and better than the S&P 500. But most active managers couldn\u2019t do it.Their chances are worse this year because the market so far has been very different. Megacap stocks have been outperforming the average stock in the S&P 500 index, and the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 has been trailing the standard, cap-weighted index. That implies that if you just pick stocks randomly, odds are that you will trail the overall stock market this year.\nAnd, in fact, preliminary tallies by Bank of America show that in a horse race between active large-cap\u00a0mutual fund managers and the S&P 500 this year, the active managers have been clobbered. Only 45 percent of active large-cap stock managers have matched the performance of the S&P 500. Stock pickers are doing better in some corners of the market, but for the most part, it\u2019s a dismal pictureImproving Your ChancesIt\u2019s definitely possible to beat the stock market. A small number of people will probably to do it over the next 20 years. But I don\u2019t know now who those outliers will be. Similarly, I don\u2019t know the precise direction of\u00a0the economy or of inflation or of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policies or of a host of other\u00a0monumentally important factors. No one else knows, either.That\u2019s why I think it makes sense to embrace humility, accept my limitations and use low-cost index funds to try to match the returns of the stock and bond markets over the long run.To do that, and to withstand the wrenching shifts in the markets that will surely come, I\u2019ll need enough cash on hand to pay the bills first. Money-market funds and high-yield, federally insured savings accounts and certificates of deposit are reasonable options for that purpose.Make your own choice. Some active stock pickers will beat the market averages this year. But based on history, I think it\u2019s virtually certain that the vast majority won\u2019t manage to do it over the next 20 years.\nBecause I\u2019m trying to improve my odds while investing for the long haul, I\u2019m aiming for an absolutely average performance.",

	"text": "Wall Street strategists are issuing forecasts for the performance of the stock market in 2024.Pay them no mind.The predictions are usually wrong, and when they\u2019re right it\u2019s only by accident.Consider their prophecies for 2023. At the end of 2022, strategists predicted that the S&P 500 would end 2023 at 4,078, a gain of 6.2 percent from where it started, according to data from Bloomberg.At the moment, the market is above 4,700, a gain of more than 22 percent. These forecasts were so deeply off the mark undoubtedly because 2022 was a truly terrible year for stocks \u2014 and also one that most analysts totally failed to foresee. So the predictions for 2023 were uncharacteristically modest, reflecting the gloom that prevailed when they were being set.The median forecast on Dec. 19 called for the S&P 500 to close 2024 at 4,750, according to Bloomberg. The projections are still shifting \u2014 and will assuredly increase if the market keeps rising. When the market rises, the forecasts typically rise, too.\nThese forecasts aren\u2019t scientific, and I only bother to address them at all because they get a tremendous amount of coverage, and they inform the advice given to thousands, and perhaps millions, of people.If you find them entertaining or otherwise illuminating \u2014 wonderful. Enjoy them.But at all costs, don\u2019t take them at face value because there is no evidence that anyone can predict the market\u2019s movements reliably, and a great deal of evidence that buying and selling stock on the basis of your views about the market\u2019s impending movements is a fool\u2019s game.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Better to invest with humility: Accept that no one knows where the market is going moment by moment, and focus on the long haul, anyway.The Big PictureOver many decades, the entire global stock market has trended upward, and as long as capitalism survives, and companies continue to profit, the stock market as a whole is likely to climb. But it certainly won\u2019t do so all the time. If you\u2019ve been in the market at all, you know that it rises and falls. These movements are, for the most part, unpredictable.Yet Wall Street strategists make predictions anyway, despite a track record that is extraordinary in its ineptitude.\nBack in 2020, using data compiled by Paul Hickey, a founder of Bespoke Investment Group, I found that since 2000 Wall Street frequently got the direction of the market wrong. At my request, Mr. Hickey has updated the data.The numbers show that from 2000 through 2023, the median Wall Street analyst forecast that the S&P 500 would rise 9 percent a year, on average. In reality, the annual increase averaged 6 percent.Even these figures understate the degree of failure.In 2018, for example, the market fell 6.9 percent, though the forecasters said it would rise 7.5 percent, a 14.4 percentage point difference. In 2002, the forecast called for an increase of 12.5 percent, but stocks fell 23.3 percent, a spread of almost 36 percentage points.And in 2022, the forecast called for an annual increase of 3.9 percent. But the stock market lost 19.4 percent. The forecasters were wrong by a margin of more than 23 percentage points.Taking gaps like these into account, the median Wall Street forecast from 2000 through 2023 missed its target by an average 13.8 percentage points annually \u2014 more than double the actual average annual performance of the stock market.\nThe Situation NowMany Wall Street strategists are astute analysts of what has already happened. But the economy and the markets shift constantly, in unexpected ways. Reliably forecasting stock market averages 12 months in advance is beyond anybody\u2019s ability.Declining inflation combined with a robust labor market has led many people to believe that the Federal Reserve will soon be cutting the short-term interest rates that it controls directly. This is seen as bullish for the stock market, which has risen in the past couple of months. The S&P 500 is on the verge of surpassing its last peak, reached in January. And if there is no recession in the next year, and interest rates do decline, it\u2019s reasonable to think that the market will keep rising.That, in a nutshell, is the bullish case. But it\u2019s easy to conjure up bearish alternatives, too.For example, if the Fed cuts interest rates prematurely, inflation could surge. The central bank may then need to raise interest rates again, as Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chair, had to do in 1981, setting off a second recession in two years.A \u201csoft landing\u201d for the economy in 2024 could be coming. But so could a recession.David Rosenberg, a veteran strategist and economist, is still predicting one, as he has since early 2022. He expects the economy to falter, interest rates to plummet and stocks to fall. \u201cTreasury bonds, not the stock market, will be the best performing asset class in 2024,\u201d he told me in an interview.Given the complexity of the world and all of the crises, big and small, that are already obvious, it would take a very long column to sketch out all of the things that could go wrong with a forecast about the next year. And I\u2019m certain that there will be major shifts that few people yet imagine.\nFortunately, you don\u2019t have to know these things to be a successful investor.The key, first of all, is to have enough money set aside to pay the bills, because investment involves some risk, and you don\u2019t want to take risks with money you absolutely need. Then, to minimize your risks while holding stocks, resolve to invest in the entire market for decades through low-cost diversified index funds, and avoid any attempt at timing the market. Wall Street predictions might tempt you to buy and sell at the wrong times. It\u2019s safer to ignore these forecasts entirely.Stocks are just part of the program. I also invest in high-quality bonds and do so the same way, with broad, low-cost index funds. Investment-grade bonds, and especially Treasuries, usually provide a buffer when stocks fall (though they didn\u2019t do so in 2022). Treasuries, in particular, are safe investments, despite the fiscal strains resulting from the failure of the U.S. government in recent years to reach consensus on spending and taxation policies.I find these forecasting exercises fascinating, and sometimes learn a great deal from them, but I don\u2019t expect any of them to provide a road map to the future.Hope for the best, prepare for the worst and get on with life. Unfortunately, Wall Street forecasts won\u2019t help with any of that.",

	"text": "Wall Street\u2019s worries eased on Tuesday, as investors took comfort from signs that a potential banking crisis appeared contained and bet on a more supportive environment for the economy going forward.The S&P 500 rose 1.7 percent, lifted by a recovery in some bank stocks and bolstered by gains for heavyweights like Microsoft and Apple, which because of their size have a bigger impact on the performance of the broader index. More than three-quarters of the stocks in the index rose on Tuesday.It\u2019s common for stocks to bounce after a substantial fall, as investors try to gauge where markets will shake out once a period of stress passes. Nonetheless, the lift in the market was a welcome reprieve for investors who have been battered by a rapidly shifting economic backdrop that has led to whipsaw moves across stock and bond markets.One dominant narrative taking shape posits that the crisis in the banking sector may lead to a more supportive environment for markets. The fallout from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank appears contained, and the episode may also give the Federal Reserve reason to forgo further interest rate increases. Higher interest rates raise costs for companies and were at the root of the stress in the banking sector, so fewer rate increases could help stocks to rebound.\n\u201cThis is giving the Fed a reason to back off and adjust what they have done,\u201d said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. \u201cAbsent further deterioration in regional banks, I think the market is grasping at the Fed being given an excuse to pause and reassess.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Fresh inflation data on Tuesday appeared to show just enough cooling to support the case for a more restrained Fed. Consumer Price Index data released before trading began showed inflation slowing slightly for the year through February, despite accelerating from the previous month.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Investors\u2019 bets on whether the Fed will raise interest rates when it meets next week tilted back to expecting a quarter-point increase, after briefly flirting with no change, still markedly lower than where expectations stood a week ago. Investors now expect the central bank to raise interest rates to a peak of around 4.9 percent, down sharply from around 5.5 percent last week. That implies an expectation of one more quarter-point increase to come, down from as many as four such increases a week ago.In the bond market, sentiment appeared less hopeful. The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, rose by more than 0.2 percentage points \u2014 a big move for an asset that usually moves in tiny fractions of a percentage point. Tuesday\u2019s rise followed a deep fall on Monday that echoed painful flash points such as the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008.Though the yield on the 10-year Treasury note still rose, it remained more anchored, suggesting fading hopes for economic growth over the long term.\n\u201cI think what is reflected in the bond market is an elevated risk of recession and a credit crunch, but for whatever reason it hasn\u2019t reached stock investors yet,\u201d Ms. Sonders said.That dissonance makes predicting the path forward even harder, with some investors warning that financial markets could be headed for more days of volatile trading as investors make sense of the murky outlook.\u201cPeople are trying to gauge what the Fed is actually going to do given all the new information since the end of last week,\u201d said Charlie Ripley, a senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management. \u201cI think there is a tremendous amount of uncertainty. The Fed really has a dilemma on its hands here.\u201d",

	"text": "Investors swiftly reshuffled their portfolios this week, as they absorbed the Federal Reserve\u2019s signals and prepared for the effects of higher interest rates for longer than they had previously thought.Stock prices slumped, the dollar soared and bond yields crept higher after the Fed meeting on Wednesday: Despite holding rates steady, a shift in Fed policymakers\u2019 predictions about how long they expected to hold interest rates at high levels prompted a sharp reassessment on Wall Street.The S&P 500 index slumped lower for the third consecutive week, despite paring some of its losses on Friday with a modest gain. It ended the week down close to 3 percent, its worst weekly performance since March, after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.The yields on longer-dated bonds, which serve as a gauge of the cost of corporate borrowing and can weigh on stock prices, rose to levels last seen in the buildup to the 2008 financial crisis. The 10-year Treasury yield briefly moved above 4.5 percent, its highest since September 2007, up roughly half a percentage point so far this month, a sizable move in that market.\nInvestors yanked nearly $18 billion from stock markets in the United States in the week through Wednesday, according to data from EPFR Global, the most in a week since late 2022, and that was before the Fed\u2019s announcements pushed yields even higher.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The stock market\u2019s rate-sensitive areas, such as technology stocks, have been particularly hard hit. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 3.6 percent for the week.\u201cInvestors appear concerned that keeping rates higher for longer will weigh on equity valuations and make it harder for the Fed to achieve a soft economic landing,\u201d Keith Lerner of Truist said in a research note on Friday.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Fed officials now predict that interest rates will end next year at 5.1 percent, according to the median projection by policymakers, markedly higher than their 4.6 percent forecast in June.The Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and many economists have expressed hope that the economy can remain resilient despite the squeeze from higher interest rates. Higher interest rates are still making their way through the economy, confronting consumers when they refinance mortgages or take out new loans, and hitting companies when they roll over debt fixed when interest rates were much lower.\nIt\u2019s partly because the economy has held up so well that the Fed expects to have to do more to try and slow it down in order to tame stubborn inflation, while trying to avoid tipping it into recession. That economic resilience should mean that the stock market \u201ccan handle higher bond yields better,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank noted.The stock market remains about 13 percent up from the start of the year, despite sharply higher interest rates. But investors are wary of putting too much confidence in predictions for the path of rates in the future.In January, trading in financial markets implied that the Fed would be cutting rates as soon as this month. Now, investors expect rate cuts to begin in the second half of next year.\u201cForecasting is very difficult,\u201d Mr. Powell said in a news conference on Wednesday. \u201cForecasters are a humble lot with much to be humble about.\u201dIn the next few months, investors must contend with the autoworkers\u2019 strike, the restart of student loan repayments and the threat of a government shutdown.\u201cThere is a lack of upside catalyst in the near term to get more bullish about,\u201d Mr. Lerner of Truist said.",

In less than a second, Verizon swung between a loss of over 17 percent and a gain of nearly 13 percent, while Wells Fargo plummeted more than 15 percent.The moves, which added or wiped out billions of dollars of market value, led the exchange to halt trading in just over 80 different shares. Stock exchanges have built-in \u201ccircuit breakers\u201d that automatically pause trading if a stock price suddenly swings by a large amount.Once trading resumed, the companies\u2019 share prices moved more or less in line with a typical trading day. Shares of Nike, Verizon and Wells Fargo, for example, had gained or lost less than 2 percent by the end of trading on Tuesday.\nThe explanation for the turmoil, the exchange said, was a malfunction in its system at a crucial time for the financial markets. Typically, the N.Y.S.E. holds an opening auction at the start of trading day, collecting orders from buyers and sellers to set the opening price of individual stocks. The exchange said that for some stocks \u201copening auctions did not occur,\u201d resulting in the market mayhem.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The whipsaw trading meant some investors will have paid much more to buy shares than the prevailing market price, while others paid much less. Some investors said their trades simply weren\u2019t executed, with significantly reduced trading volumes. Traders said they expected much of the activity to be reversed.\u201cSomebody is having an unhappy day,\u201d said Edward Monrad, head of market structure at Optiver, a so-called market maker, which is a type of business expected to buy and sell shares to facilitate trading. \u201cThose trades will most likely get busted, which means people are sitting on trades that they are uncertain exist.\u201dBy the afternoon, the N.Y.S.E. said its member firms could flag erroneous trades or request compensation for losses arising from Tuesday\u2019s events, in accordance with its rules. The exchange later said some trades in over 250 stocks would automatically be declared \u201cnull and void.\u201dSome investors had earlier raised concerns about the extent of the price moves, before circuit breakers were set off. Exchanges like the N.Y.S.E. use what are known as \u201climit up, limit down\u201d triggers to stop trading in a stock if its price moves too much, too quickly.\nAt the open, this is typically set at 5 percent or 10 percent above and below the stock\u2019s opening price. These triggers are designed to protect investors from sharp moves, allowing markets a moment to pause and reset prices before they spiral out of control.Trade data shows, however, that some transactions were executed outside these ranges.The tobacco company Altria ended Monday at a price of $44.81. It opened on Tuesday up over 15 percent at $51.57, which appeared to set the stock\u2019s lower trading limit 5 percent lower at $48.99. Yet within milliseconds trades were executed around $47, $38, $42, $45 and $44 before the price jumped back to $48.99, according to reported trade data.Some of these trades were among those the N.Y.S.E. said it would reverse.Reversing trades, though, could create further problems for investors who were unsure if they had bought or sold stock, or not. This could also knock on to trades conducted on other exchanges affected by the volatility on the N.Y.S.E.",

	"text": "Stocks slumped on Tuesday, as fears about the health of the financial sector after the collapse of First Republic Bank collided with broader anxiety stemming from signs of a weakening economy.Some regional banks, which have been under pressure since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed in March, took sizable hits on Tuesday, shattering the relative calm that prevailed after First Republic was seized and sold to JPMorgan Chase by regulators on Monday.PacWest\u2019s stock lost almost 30 percent of its value, its worst single-day drop since the height of the banking turmoil in March. Western Alliance sank about 15 percent, while Comerica and Zions also suffered double-digit percentage declines.The moves came alongside data showing U.S. manufacturers received fewer new orders than expected in March and a continued cooling of the labor market that month, with job openings falling and layoffs rising. Oil prices fell sharply, too, as the prospects of an economic downturn would likely cut energy demand. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped to around $75, near its lowest level for the year.\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent. Energy stocks fell by the most, with the sector as a whole down more than 4 percent, followed by financials, down 2.3 percent.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThe bank problem is going to be ongoing,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. \u201cThe idea that giving First Republic to JPMorgan would end this, I never believed it. There is a real fear of instability and an economic slowdown.\u201dSome investors have made bumper returns betting on the drops in bank stocks, a practice known as short selling. Metropolitan Bank has seen the biggest increase in bearish bets over the past 30 days, according to data from S3 Partners. More than 10 percent of the bank\u2019s stock is now lent to short-sellers. Nearly 20 percent of PacWest\u2019s shares are out on loan, however that number has fallen slightly over the past month.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, sought to temper concerns over the stability of the banking system on Tuesday. \u201cWe have the tools necessary to keep our banking system safe and protect depositors,\u201d she told reporters.Investors also expressed anxiety about the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank is expected to raise interest rates. The Fed has raised rates rapidly over the past year in an attempt to cool the economy and tame stubbornly high inflation. But higher rates have also been the root of the trouble at banks.\nSome investors worry that pushing rates even higher could prompt another wave of turmoil, as consumers move bank deposits, which earn relatively little in interest, to alternatives like money market funds, which offer higher returns. To retain customers, banks could offer higher interest on deposits, but that squeezes their profit margins.\u201cSo far the Fed has seemed rather obtuse,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \u201cThey are so laser-focused on inflation, which is a rearview-mirror issue, rather than being focused on the damage they could cause by hiking rates further.\u201dBased on market prices, investors still expect the Fed to increase interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday. But that conviction has weakened somewhat, with bets tilting toward cuts to rates as soon as September, an outcome that\u2019s likely only if inflation falls precipitously or the economy slides into a severe recession.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, fell almost a fifth of a point on Tuesday, to below 4 percent, a big move for an asset that usually moves by hundredths of a percentage point each day.Elsewhere, a survey of bank lending conditions published Tuesday by the European Central Bank showed lenders in the eurozone pulling back from lending at a pace faster than that of any time since the 2011 European debt crisis. Worries about a credit crunch squeezing the economy are also becoming more prominent among policymakers in the United States.Adding to the murky outlook, U.S. lawmakers have yet to agree on a deal to raise the ceiling on the amount of debt the government can take on, with administration officials warning that it could run out of money by June.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.",

Despite political brinkmanship over the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, a banking crisis in March, fears over the cost of funding the government\u2019s fiscal deficit, a continuing war in Ukraine and fresh conflict in Israel, the core of Mr. Lee\u2019s prediction came to fruition in 2023. Inflation has fallen, unemployment remains low, and the S&P 500 has risen 25 percent.Most investors disagreed with Mr. Lee\u2019s prognosis; in 2023, they pulled more than $70 billion out of funds that buy U.S. stocks, according to data from EPFR Global. Only a quarter of fund managers whose performance is benchmarked to the S&P 500 have beaten the index\u2019s returns this year, according to Morningstar Direct.\u201c2023 was a year that people were so convinced we would have a recession and they looked at everything through that lens,\u201d said Mr. Lee, head of research for Fundstrat. \u201cThen there were folks like us that said we don\u2019t know the future but there is little evidence a recession is coming.\u201d\nHeading into 2024, prognosticators tracked by Bloomberg share Mr. Lee\u2019s optimism more broadly, including analysts at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Binky Chadha, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank who bet against the consensus with Mr. Lee last year, is also predicting that the bull rally will continue.At the same time, analysts at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and others maintain that the absence of a severe downturn in 2023 doesn\u2019t mean it has been avoided altogether, since the full effect of higher interest rates is still working through the economy.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThere are a lot of things that have to go right to still come out the other side unscathed,\u201d said Mike Wilson, chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He revised his bearish bets in July, although even then he didn\u2019t budge from his stance that the economy would worsen.Central to both views is the path of inflation and whether the Federal Reserve can return the pace of price rises back to its target of 2 percent before the economy sputters.The Fed began putting the brakes on the economy in March 2022 by raising interest rates. But the central bank has recently appeared confident that it is getting close to its target. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.1 percent over the year through November, down from a peak of over 9 percent through June 2022. Core C.P.I., which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remains at 4 percent.\nThe sooner the Fed gets to its target, the sooner it can start to take its foot off the brakes of the economy. The central bank recently forecast lower interest rates next year. Even without rate cuts, falling inflation and historically high wage growth could embolden consumers to keep spending, offering a tailwind for corporate profits to soar even higher, Mr. Lee said.\nOthers are less confident. While the labor market remains strong, recent months have shown early signs of weakness, with a modest rise in unemployment as more people begin seeking work. Credit card delinquencies and the number of people overdue on car loan repayments are also rising, as investors note that consumer finances have become more stretched after the repeal of plans to forgive student loan debt. With inflation still above the Fed\u2019s target, these cracks could widen in the coming year.Jason Hunter, an equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, said the market appeared to be ignoring an expected slowdown in growth next year. \u201cThe equity market looks like it is priced for a very rosy outcome,\u201d he said.While the service side of the economy, such as restaurants, has held up well this year, manufacturing has struggled after a stretch of overproduction in 2022.\nEnergy stocks remain negative for the year, after being the standout performer in 2022. Utilities stocks \u2014 typically a haven when other parts of the market are in turmoil, thanks to their steady income stream \u2014 have fallen more than 10 percent since January. Smaller companies, too, have languished, with the Russell 2000 index still roughly 15 percent off its previous peak and18 percent higher for the year.For Mr. Lee and the growing herd of market bulls, these unloved areas of the market offer an opportunity in 2024. A turn in the manufacturing slump, as companies work through the backlog of inventories and begin placing new orders, could help companies that struggled in 2023 catch up.Mr. Chadha of Deutsche Bank noted that economists had consistently underappreciated the amount of growth in the economy this year. He thinks it\u2019s likely to happen again.\u201cWe think we will get positive-growth surprises that will propel equities higher,\u201d he said.Those who are more bearish say that a manufacturing recovery is far from assured and that the slide in those sectors of the market in 2023 could be a warning that if it weren\u2019t for a few behemoth technology stocks that lifted the S&P 500 higher, the stock rally would look very different.These tech stocks have been so dominant, they even earned themselves the nickname the Magnificent Seven. It\u2019s a group that boasts some of the biggest companies in the market: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. Without them, the S&P 500 would have risen around 10 percent this year.\n\u201cIf average companies don\u2019t see an improvement, that to me is the risk of a hard landing,\u201d Mr. Wilson of Morgan Stanley said. \u201cIf we are going to have a recession, it\u2019ll be when these businesses decide to start letting people go.\u201dFor Mr. Lee, history suggests a different outcome. When the S&P 500 has risen by at least 15 percent for the year, which has happened 28 times back to 1950, the index has risen by another 10 percent the next year half the time, and is positive over 70 percent of the time, he said. And when interest rates have previously been between 3 and 5 percent, the valuation of the stock market has been similar to what it is now, suggesting the rally isn\u2019t overdone.\u201cPeople are trying to be too theoretical about the stock market,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cThe acceptance of chaos is a more correct way to approach the market.\u201d",

And Berkshire\u2019s cash stake swelled to a record $157.2 billion in the third quarter, when it sold $5.3 billion more stocks than it bought.Berkshire also slowed repurchases of its own stock, buying back $1.1 billion in the third quarter.Investors watch Berkshire closely because its results often reflect broader economic trends and because of Mr. Buffett\u2019s reputation as a savvy investor.The third-quarter net loss more than quadrupled to $12.77 billion from about $2.8 billion a year earlier.\nResults included $23.5 billion in losses from investments, primarily reflecting a 12 percent decline in the stock price of Apple, in which Berkshire owned a $157 billion stake, as of Sept 30.Berkshire\u2019s net results swing widely from quarter to quarter because accounting rules require the company to report investment gains and losses even if it buys and sells nothing. Mr. Buffett says the resulting volatility is usually meaningless.Operating profit rose 41 percent to $10.76 billion from $7.65 billion a year earlier.Insurance operations generated $4.89 billion of profit, as the Geico car insurer and reinsurance businesses made money after posting losses in 2022, while rising interest rates boosted income generated from U.S. Treasuries.Berkshire also benefited from a relatively quiet Atlantic hurricane season, which reduced catastrophe losses, unlike in 2022 when it lost $2.7 billion from Hurricane Ian.But revenues at its BNSF freight railroad were down 15.3 percent in the quarter on lower volumes and higher non-fuel expenses. Its businesses tied to the housing market also saw declines because of rising mortgage interest rates and fewer existing homes for sale as well as a drop in demand for mortgage refinancing. Revenues from its real estate brokerage business declined 13.8 percent in the third quarter.\nBerkshire also reported that revenues from its apparel and footwear businesses fell 11.2 percent on a decline in customer demand.Mr. Buffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965. His $117.5 billion net worth ranks fifth worldwide according to Forbes magazine.Berkshire shares are up 14 percent this year, matching the return of the S&P 500.",

	"text": "It isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s more important than ever.I\u2019m talking about the 60/40 portfolio, which has sometimes been considered the living heart of investing. Those specific numbers \u2014 which refer to 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds as core investment holdings \u2014 aren\u2019t significant. They are merely a convenient starting point for thinking about investing and not an exact, general-purpose prescription for everyone. Nor have they ever been.But they do represent a fundamental principle. While it\u2019s more complicated, it comes down to this: Don\u2019t keep your eggs in one basket. Diversify rigorously and systematically among stocks and bonds, and do it for the long haul.The claim that this concept is dead doesn\u2019t make sense. Diversification in investing is as important now as it ever was, even if it hasn\u2019t paid off lately.But what is true is that both stocks and bonds performed poorly over much of the last two years, especially in 2022. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates led to bond losses along with a drop in the stock market. If you held a broad portfolio of stocks and bonds in 2022 \u2014 whether your mix was 60/40 or some other variant \u2014 you probably lost money. Neither the stocks nor the bonds helped.\nThat was awful. But the solution isn\u2019t to abandon diversification. It is to stick with it, and maybe even diversify further.The Core ConceptHarry Markowitz was a giant of finance. He was also an earthy Chicagoan, who told me back in 2012 that he was comfortable with using eggs in a basket to describe his work, for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1990.\u201cWhat I did was a lot fancier than that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needed a lot of math.\u201d But the basic concept is that if all of your investments are the same and something bad happens to any one of them, you will be in, let us say, deep trouble. Don\u2019t let that happen to you.Harry died in June. In 2012, he explained how you could reduce total risk by combining a lot of individually risky assets. If their price movements are poorly or even inversely correlated \u2014 so that some rise while others fall \u2014 your portfolio will become more stable. This is the core of what has become known as \u201cmodern portfolio theory.\u201dIt emphasizes asset allocation over individual stock and bond picking, and accepting only the risk you can handle by selecting your investment mix along what he called \u201can efficient frontier.\u201d \nThis gets wonky, but in simple terms, he advised setting up your portfolio for the long haul, so you could ignore the constant financial crises that obsess so many people on Wall Street. Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Is the market up or down today? Don\u2019t even think about it. That\u2019s advice that I have taken to heart.Now, though, this core approach to investing has come under criticism. Why? The stock market, as represented by the S&P 500, lost 18 percent in 2022. The bond market, defined by a popular benchmark, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, lost 13 percent. Diversification didn\u2019t protect you in 2022.Popularizing 60/40Benjamin Graham, the Columbia University finance professor who taught Warren Buffett about value investing, suggested, in various editions of \u201cThe Intelligent Investor,\u201d that a stock and bond portfolio should be at least 20 percent stock and perhaps as much as 80 percent. He settled on a 50/50 split, not 60/40, as a reasonable starting point, altering the stock allocation depending on market conditions.But 60/40 became reasonably popular late in the 20th century. Peter L. Bernstein, the economic historian, once explained the logic of a 60/40 allocation this way: Long-term investors should favor the stock market over bonds because stocks have a higher ceiling, but bonds are a balm because they are safer. So tilt toward stock, while holding a lot of bonds, leaving a 60/40 allocation, as a starting point.\nJohn C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and the creator of the first commercially available, broad, low-cost index funds, popularized the 60/40 portfolio as much as anybody when he created the Vanguard Balanced fund \u2014 a simple 60/40 blend of a broad Vanguard U.S. stock fund and a U.S. bond fund. (It lost almost 17 percent in 2022.)Even Jack, as he insisted I call him, said 60/40 wasn\u2019t the only way to go. Vanguard\u2019s oldest fund is a balanced fund, the Wellington Fund, and it contains 65 percent stock and 35 percent bonds. Other Vanguard funds have different allocations. All had big losses in 2022 but have done well over long periods.So what mix is ideal? I don\u2019t know. One notion is to hold more stock when you are young and more bonds as you age, though Jack himself didn\u2019t do that. He was a risk taker, and held well more than 60 percent stock in his personal portfolio, he told me, when he was well into his 80s.The important issue isn\u2019t whether a 60/40 portfolio mix is best. It may not be. But all traditional balanced portfolios are mixtures of stocks and bonds seeking to lower risk through diversification. And they are all open to the main complaint. Diversification didn\u2019t work well in 2022.A Bigger UniverseOne answer is to diversify even further. The Vanguard Balanced and Wellington funds are both U.S.-only funds. But modern portfolio theory suggests that you hold a piece of the entire investable publicly traded stock and bond universe.\nIn other words, go global. Use low-cost index funds (or actively managed funds, if that\u2019s your preference) that range across the whole planet. That\u2019s the approach I take and that academic finance generally recommends.It hasn\u2019t helped, though, if your goal is to minimize losses and maximize gains. The U.S. stock and bond markets have outperformed the rest of the world\u2019s markets for years. At some point, I assume that this will turn around and that global diversification will pay off in the long run, as academic theory suggests. But it hasn\u2019t been a satisfying solution lately.Another option is to expand beyond stocks and bonds. The safest alternative is probably cash, which includes Treasury bills and money-market funds.They have been stellar performers, now that the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates above 5 percent in its battle against inflation. Increasing cash holdings and substituting money-market funds for some of your longer-term bonds has been an effective tactical move over the last year or two, and cash may be considered part of a core, classic portfolio, though getting the timing right is tricky.Shifting between cash and longer-term fixed-income holdings requires you to closely pay attention to interest rates and know when to move in and out of longer-term fixed-income holdings. It\u2019s hard to get that right.\nAnother possibility is to tweak your fixed-income holdings in terms of duration, credit quality and nationality, though indexed investment-grade holdings of bonds denominated in your home currency \u2014 dollars, if you are American \u2014 may be all you really need.Readjustments like these can be appropriate for classic, core investment portfolios.But that\u2019s about as far as I would go.AlternativesThere are many other tempting alternatives.Even those who favor core stock and bond portfolios have sometimes called for adding other asset classes \u2014 like gold or real estate \u2014 to basic diversified investments, though some studies have shown that they provide minimal protection, at best.There\u2019s no shortage of reports from asset management firms arguing that hedge funds and private equity funds need to be added into the intelligent investor\u2019s mix. And you can also delve into futures and options that can limit your losses, at a cost. Once you\u2019ve started down this route, why not go further afield? Cryptocurrency: People in the industry claim that it\u2019s an asset class and should be represented in your portfolio.I\u2019ve not seen solid evidence that any of these things are needed as core investments. As a proxy for a plain vanilla 60/40 U.S.-oriented portfolio, consider Jack Bogle\u2019s humble Vanguard Balanced fund. True, its return was terrible in 2022: minus 17 percent. But since its inception in 1992, it has gained 7.8 percent annualized, or a cumulative 900 percent. Over the last 12 months, it\u2019s up almost 10 percent. There\u2019s nothing broken about any of that.\nStocks and bonds, for the most part, are not declining in tandem this year. Diversification seems to be working again.Of course, I can\u2019t say what will happen in the future, and, clearly, the core approach won\u2019t protect you from losses all the time. But no one ever promised that it would.Keep your costs low, invest broadly \u2014 and stick with it. It\u2019s a simple approach and a proven one. Despite painful lurches, there are good reasons to believe that it will work for years to come.",

	"text": "It was a great year for the stock market and for the vast majority of investors in workplace retirement accounts.But let\u2019s not get carried away.Even after the 2023 gains, most stock investors are only barely above water since the start of 2022. It looks better when you include dividends. Then, the S&P 500 returned 3.42 percent over the course of the two calendar years. Even so, the paltry stock market increases haven\u2019t kept up with inflation.If you can stand the pain, recall the simultaneous declines in the stock and bond markets that made 2022 a terrible year for investors. It was arguably even worse than 2008, when the stock market collapsed during the great financial crisis. In 2022, bonds declined sharply in value as interest rates rose, while during the financial crisis, investment-grade bonds rallied as interest rates declined.Lately, the markets have been much kinder to investors, with both stocks and bonds holding their own.The good returns for 2023 are thanks in no small part to the brilliant performance of the last three months of the year \u2014 fueled by growing expectations that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession, and that the Federal Reserve will soon begin to cut short-term interest rates.\nThe final quarterly and annual numbers for 2023 were exceptionally good. They translate into substantial annual gains for millions of investors who hold stocks and bonds indirectly, through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and trusts, often in workplace retirement accounts.So if you have held broadly diversified investments that track the markets, endured the bad times of 2022 and persevered through 2023, you are probably doing OK. You may even be slightly ahead of where your portfolio stood at the start of 2022.Good TidingsLet\u2019s review the good times of late 2023.The S&P 500, which tracks the most valuable stocks in the U.S. market, rose 11.2 percent in the last quarter \u2014 and had a total return of 11.7 percent, including dividends. For the year, it gained 24.2 percent and returned 26.3 percent, including dividends.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Broader U.S. stock indexes, like the Russell 3000, the FT Wilshire 5000 and the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index, which include smaller stocks as well as the giants in the S&P 500, also had a total return of around 26 percent for 2023.Rank-and-file fund investors shared in most of those gains, the database maintained by Morningstar, the financial service company, shows. The average U.S. domestic stock mutual fund and exchange-traded fund returned 11.3 percent for the fourth quarter and 20.3 percent for the year.\nNote that the average fund substantially lagged the broad stock market averages. Most funds are actively managed, by professionals trying to beat the market. By contrast, broad low-cost index funds, which merely seek to mirror the markets, generally did their job well.For example, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund returned 12.3 percent for the quarter and 26.1 percent for the year, beating the average fund as well as the S&P 500. That, in a nutshell, is why I believe it\u2019s better for most people to use low-cost index funds.Most global markets also did well in 2023 \u2014 and, as usual, the average fund trailed the market returns. For example, an important global benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index (often known as ACWI) returned more than 21 percent in 2023. The average international fund in the Morningstar database returned only 14.3 percent Of course, some individual stocks did much better than average. Nvidia, which makes advanced computer chips, rose 239 percent in 2023. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, gained 194 percent, after falling 64 percent the previous year on investor skepticism about the company\u2019s focus, back then, on the so-called metaverse. In 2023, though, these big tech stocks benefited from the artificial intelligence frenzy and lifted the S&P 500. Perhaps more surprising, cruise lines surged, too: Royal Caribbean soared 162 percent, and Carnival rose 130 percent. If you had focused on any of these stocks at the start of 2023, you would have been winner.Then again, most stocks underperformed the averages. Dollar General, Moderna and Est\u00e9e Lauder, all important S&P 500 stocks, lost more than 40 percent in 2023.\nStock picking and market timing are tricky and time-consuming. I avoid both practices and seek utterly average market returns, which are better than most active traders obtain.Enduring Bond LossesThe picture for bonds improved, too, but with a major caveat. Many people who traded bonds or held bond funds since the start of 2022 haven\u2019t yet recovered their losses.While those who bought and held individual investment-grade bonds in 2022 have done just fine, the performance of bond funds wasn\u2019t nearly good enough to make up for the declines of the previous year.When interest rates rise, as they did in 2022, bond prices fall. Bond fund returns are a combination of income and price changes, and in 2022, the price declines far outweighed the income.Fortunately for investors, that changed in 2023. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index, a widely followed benchmark for investment-grade bonds and core bond funds, returned 5.5 percent for the year, according to FactSet. But the losses in 2022 were so great that over two years, the Aggregate Bond index was still down 8.2 percent, and so were many bond funds.\nIt was even worse for longer-duration bonds. Because of the way bond math works, when interest rates rise, they lose more in price than shorter-term bonds. One proxy for longer-term bonds, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, rose 2.8 percent for 2023, yet it was still down more than 29 percent for the two years combined.The fixed-income universe is enormous. I\u2019ll return to it in future columns. But the lesson here is that while bond funds are usually steadier and safer than stock funds, that\u2019s not always the case. It depends on when you\u2019re investing, and in which bonds.So Now What?Interest rates, inflation, and the strength of the economy are key factors for both stocks and bonds.It would be good to know in advance how all these things will play out.But we don\u2019t know, and nobody forecasts well enough to rely on these predictions for investing, year in and year out.Fortunately, to prosper as an investor, it\u2019s not necessary to know what will happen in the world in the next several months or years.\nFrom a longer perspective, I\u2019d say that what we\u2019ve been experiencing over the last couple of years looks a lot like mean reversion \u2014 the markets pulling themselves back into their customary, long-term upward trajectory, after terrible trials. Expect more of the same: periodic bouts of market misery, interspersed with stretches of gains, giving long-term, low-cost, buy-and-hold investors handsome returns, if they have the strength to hang on during a tumultuous ride.I base that assertion on history. Including the final tally for 2023, the average annual return for the S&P 500 since 1926 has been 10.4 percent. That means it has taken less than seven years, on average, for the U.S. stock market to double in value.Getting those kinds of returns in the future isn\u2019t a sure thing. They certainly won\u2019t be pain-free.Precisely because there are no guarantees, this decades-long strategy won\u2019t work when your horizon is short, as many older readers have pointed out. In that situation, locking in returns at the relatively high interest rates that prevail at the moment makes more sense than a long-term, \u201cset it and forget it\u201d approach.Whatever your investing horizon, enjoy these better times in the markets but be prudent. The losses of 2022 provided a vivid reminder of how important it is to set up your portfolio so you can tolerate market agony. Hope the current calm continues but be ready for trouble, whenever it comes.",

	"text": "Last week, the Federal Reserve held off raising interest rates after 10 increases in a row, instead waiting to assess how the economy has responded to the sharp rise in rates so far. This week, stock investors also paused for reflection, putting the recent rally on hold until the outlook becomes clearer.The S&P 500 recorded its first weekly decline since early May, ending the index\u2019s longest streak of gains since 2021. The S&P 500 has risen roughly 13 percent this year, and more than 20 percent since hitting its low point in October last year, crossing a technical threshold for the start of a bull market, a term used by Wall Street to describe a period of investing enthusiasm. Even after a slump on Friday, this week\u2019s fall shaved off just 1.4 percent from the index\u2019s previous gains.Stocks of smaller companies more exposed to the risk of a slump in the U.S. economy fell further. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks these domestically focused companies, has fallen every day this week and racked up a loss of 2.9 percent for the week \u2014 its worst since the turmoil in the banking sector in March.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.A more cautious, subdued tone to the past week\u2019s trading reflected the message delivered by Fed officials: More rate increases may be necessary, further raising costs for consumers and companies, but decisions will be guided by signals from the economy in upcoming data releases on inflation, jobs and other indicators. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during congressional testimony on Thursday that \u201cthe data will tell us what to do\u201d on future rate increases.\nIn other words, both Fed policymakers and investors are waiting for more information to decide whether interest rates will continue to rise, which will in turn guide how the stock market reacts.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cMarkets and the Fed are looking at the same data and having the same thoughts,\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cThey haven\u2019t often been on the same page this year.\u201dLast week, the Fed acknowledged that the economy had proved more resilient than expected to the central bank\u2019s attempts to slow it down and cool inflation as a result. This week, investors appeared to acknowledge that the economy\u2019s strength may warrant higher rates: For months, investors have questioned the Fed\u2019s resolve to keep raising rates, helping propel stocks upward.Investor bets on the number of rate increases by the Fed this year have nudged higher, with investors now expecting one more quarter-point increase by the end of the year. That is still less than policymakers\u2019 own forecast, which calls for two increases this year, but it\u2019s closer than it has been in the past: Until recently, investors thought the Fed might cut rates at the end of the year.The remaining disagreement, some investors say, stems from the caution that some Fed officials have expressed about the outlook. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, had supported previous rate increases. But this week, he said that he expected to hold rates where they were now through the end of the year.\nElsewhere, other central banks continued their rate-raising campaigns this week, with the Bank of England and Norway\u2019s Norges Bank surprising investors with bigger-than-expected moves.Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments, said that the market and the Fed \u201chave arrived at the same interpretation of the world,\u201d which warrants a wait-and-see approach. What happens next depends on how quickly inflation falls, and \u201cthe pace of disinflation has been so uncertain so far,\u201d she said.Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Stocks rose for a second day on Tuesday, with shares of regional lenders sharply higher, as investors awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on whether it will hold off on further interest rate increases that have already shaken the financial system.The S&P 500 index rose 1.3 percent, in step with markets in Europe and Asia.Bank shares rallied, as Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen expressed confidence in the nation\u2019s banks on Tuesday and suggested that the government would step in to protect smaller banks if needed. Some lawmakers in Washington are discussing ways to raise the limit for federal deposit insurance above $250,000, possibly by temporarily increasing the cap on accounts that are used for activities like payroll.Already, financial markets had begun to settle on Monday after measures were taken to shore up Europe\u2019s banks, with Swiss regulators orchestrating the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.\u201cThe signal of confidence is what is most important,\u201d analysts at Wells Fargo noted, referring to the deal.First Republic Bank, the regional lender that has become the focus of Wall Street\u2019s concerns about the U.S. banking system, rose more than 29 percent in afternoon trading, a heady gain that nonetheless recovered only a small fraction of the value of its beaten-down shares. First Republic\u2019s stock has still fallen about 90 percent this month, erasing tens of billions of dollars in market value.\nThe bank has been entertaining some possible buyers after a $30 billion cash infusion from the country\u2019s largest banks failed to restore confidence among investors. Analysts at Morningstar \u201cstruggle with why a buyer would be motivated to step in, except perhaps if it were being pushed for by regulators,\u201d they wrote in a new report about First Republic\u2019s prospects.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Still, investors took solace from the authorities\u2019 support. An index that tracks the largest banks in Europe, which have been swept up in the turmoil after U.S. regulators seized two midsize lenders, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, jumped 4 percent. UBS gained 12 percent in Switzerland.Shares of other regional banks also rose. Zions Bancorporation gained 7 percent, while PacWest Bancorp jumped nearly 19 percent, and Western Alliance rallied about 15 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.However, investors said the current calm might portend a storm. A critical question, particularly for those worried about the effects of higher interest rates on banks\u2019 balance sheets, is what the Fed will do when its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, meets this week.Higher interest rates have helped slow the economy and lower stubborn inflation, but they have also raised costs for companies and contributed to the instability in the banking sector. Lower rates could support the banks, but at the risk of letting inflation get out of control.\n\u201cThe competing objectives of continuing the campaign to re-establish price stability while ensuring against further banking sector contagion has presented a meaningful challenge to the F.O.M.C.,\u201d analysts at BMO Capital Markets wrote.Before stress in the banking system erupted, investors were braced for an increase of half a percentage point in interest rates. Now, the consensus is for a quarter-point increase, while some investors and economists believe that the Fed might not raise rates at all.The uncertainty shows just how quickly the banking crisis has upended views in the markets. A few weeks ago, the question was whether the Fed would ramp up the pace of its interest rate increases. Now, traders are betting on a series of rate cuts beginning in the summer.Economists have begun to warn that the trouble in the financial system could weigh on the broader economy, if lenders begin to pull back as they look to shore up their own finances.\u201cRecent events strengthen our conviction that a recession remains the most likely outcome for the economy over the next year,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote.That is not necessarily a bad thing for markets, as analysts at Bank of America pointed out that a gauge of investor pessimism had plumbed depths associated with the low point in markets during previous cycles. In addition to the recent gains for stocks, oil prices and yields on government bonds \u2014 two key measures of concerns about the economy \u2014 rose for a second session on Tuesday.",

	"text": "Stocks in China tumbled and the currency weakened on Monday after the country\u2019s central bank announced a smaller-than-expected cut in a key interest rate.Many investors and economists had been expecting Beijing to act more decisively on interest rates as China faces falling housing prices, weak consumer spending and broad debt troubles.The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, shaved only a tenth of a percentage point off the benchmark one-year interest rate used for most corporate loans, with no change at all in the five-year rate used for pricing mortgages. The slight reduction for one-year loans was the second time in two months that the government had pushed down commercial banks\u2019 lending rates.The modest scale of the cut on Monday was the latest sign that the government\u2019s usual tools for addressing an economic slowdown may have lost some of their effectiveness, economists said.\n\u201cThis will provide only modest support to credit growth and wider economic activity,\u201d Capital Economics, a London research firm, said in a note.\nGlobal investment banks have rushed to reduce their forecasts of the Chinese economy\u2019s growth, for which Beijing has a target this year of \u201caround 5 percent.\u201d UBS announced on Monday, shortly before the interest rate cut, that it was lowering its expectations for growth to 4.8 percent this year and 4.2 percent next year. Nomura of Japan is even gloomier, predicting on Friday that growth will be 4.6 percent this year while keeping its forecast for next year at 3.9 percent.The CSI 300 index of large Chinese companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 1.4 percent on Monday, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, which also includes many large Chinese companies, tumbled 1.8 percent to its lowest level since November. The Hang Seng has fallen for seven consecutive sessions and is down more than 12 percent in August.The renminbi closed weaker than 7.3 to the dollar on Monday in Shanghai trading, a level that the Chinese government tried to maintain last November, when the currency was at its weakest since 2007. It weakened even more on Monday in Hong Kong, where trading is less tightly controlled. It took more than 7.335 renminbi to buy $1 by midafternoon there.\nThe authorities in Beijing use the country\u2019s cash reserves and state-controlled banks to buy and sell currencies in an effort to limit moves in the renminbi\u2019s value against the dollar.The renminbi suddenly rebounded a bit in the final minutes of Shanghai and Hong Kong trading. The Chinese government has a long history of intervening in currency markets at the end of trading sessions to prevent closing prices from showing sharp changes.As a result, many investors view intraday movements of the renminbi, which is also known as the yuan, as a truer measure of its value.\u201cThe intraday shows you the direction the market wants to take the yuan, and the close is more likely to show you the government\u2019s action,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics in London.The rate cut announced on Monday was intended to make it a little cheaper for companies and households to borrow money and to make payments on existing loans. But the full effect of the reduction may be delayed because the interest rates on most loans are reset annually, often at the start of each year.\nThe central bank, in consultation with state-controlled commercial banks, reduced the one-year benchmark interest rate for corporate loans to 3.45 percent, from 3.55 percent. The benchmark interest rate for five-year loans stayed at 4.2 percent.A survey of 35 economists by Reuters last week showed that all of them expected the central bank to reduce interest rates for five-year loans as well as one-year loans. Last week, the central bank lowered borrowing costs for commercial banks by 0.15 percentage points. By making a more modest cut in the one-year lending rate and leaving the five-year rate untouched, policymakers were, in effect, widening the profit margins for banks.China\u2019s commercial banks have lent enormous amounts in recent years to developers and home buyers \u2014 the same groups that have been hit hardest by China\u2019s housing crash.More than 50 developers have already defaulted or stopped payments on overseas bonds. Country Garden has become the country\u2019s largest developer to run into financial difficulties, with some $200 billion in unpaid bills.The opaque accounting of China\u2019s state-controlled financial system has made it difficult for outsiders to discern the scale of the banks\u2019 real-estate-related losses. Wider profit margins on loans could help banks accumulate more reserves to offset these losses.",

	"text": "So many people expect a recession soon that it will almost be surprising if a downturn doesn\u2019t happen.After all, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates for more than a year to tame inflation. Credit conditions have already tightened and some regional banks have failed. Although the job market is still stubbornly strong, even the staff economists at the Fed anticipate an economic slowdown that will be severe enough to count as a recession.That\u2019s particularly worrisome for investors because recessions are typically associated with double-digit stock market declines. In 2020, for example, during a bear market and recession near the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the S&P 500 dropped nearly 34 percent from its peak.Will we really have a recession this year? I don\u2019t know. But recessions are a regular part of life. Having experienced six of them in my career, along with countless up and down markets, I accept that I can\u2019t reliably forecast these important events, and neither can anyone else.\nYet I remain a constant investor anyway, mainly by keeping plenty of cash in safe places and by maintaining a resolutely long-term view that is grounded in history.It\u2019s not always easy to hang on. Uncertainty about what\u2019s coming next can make investing excruciating.But you may find some comfort from the past.Stocks have always bounced back after previous recessions, sometimes quite rapidly. Investment returns calculated at my request by Dimensional Fund Advisors, a large asset management company based in Austin, Texas, show that the market has performed reasonably well over periods of 10 or 20 years after economic downturns, if not always over shorter periods.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Calling RecessionsA recession is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,\u201d according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the quasi-official entity that declares when recessions start and stop in the United States.That sounds straightforward enough. But for a large and complex economy, determining when a recession has taken place is no simple matter, even after it has happened.\nThe bureau doesn\u2019t rush in making these judgments.We won\u2019t know for sure that we\u2019ve had a recession until well after it\u2019s started, and, quite probably, not until long after it\u2019s ended. That\u2019s what happened for the last recession. It started in February 2020, near the beginning of the pandemic, and ended in April 2020. But the bureau waited 15 months, until July 2021, to declare that a recession had ended. \u201cEarlier determinations took between four and 21 months,\u201d the bureau says. \u201cThere is no fixed timing rule. We wait long enough so that the existence of a peak or trough is not in doubt, and until we can assign an accurate peak or trough date.\u201dOften, stocks fall before a recession starts and rise before it\u2019s over.The economic research bureau \u201cdates recessions only after they\u2019ve begun,\u201d Marlena Lee, the global head of investment solutions at Dimensional Fund Advisors, said in an email. \u201cMarkets, on the other hand, call them well in advance.\u201dHistorical ReturnsAt my request, Ms. Lee examined all 11 U.S. recessions since 1948 and calculated the S&P 500\u2019s annualized total returns, including dividends, starting with the first day of the month after the recession started.I find these averages reassuring:One year after the starting dates, the S&P 500 returned 6.4 percent.Three years after the starting dates, it returned 12.1 percent.Five years later, it returned 10.4 percent.Ten years later, it returned 12 percent.Twenty years later, it returned 11.5 percent.Consider that, with compounding, $1 in the index would be worth $10.56 after 20 years, on average. So far, so good.Now for the caveats.These are only long-term averages, and there are big variations among them.The best 20-year return, which occurred in the two decades starting in February 1980, was 17.2 percent, annualized. That would transform $1 into $24.02 after 20 years.\nThe worst 20-year return, in the decades starting in May 1960, was 7.3 percent annualized. That would have changed $1 into $4.09 after 20 years.Obviously, I\u2019d rather have $24.02 in my pocket but even $4.09 would have represented a sizable gain.Nasty LossesThe variation in returns was much greater over shorter periods. One year after the recession of 1953, for example, an investment in the S&P 500 would have gained nearly 32 percent.But some years were truly painful. The stock market was still down one year after the start of three recessions, in 1973, 1981 and 2007. The last of those was the financial crisis, and it was the worst.One year after that recession began, the S&P 500, with dividends, was down 37 percent. Another way of putting it is that if you put $1 into the index at the start of the recession, it shrank to just 63 cents one year later.\nAfter three years, you were still in a hole: Your dollar had grown to just 92 cents. After five years, in 2012, you were ahead, but not by much. Your dollar was $1.09. The total at the 10-year mark in 2017 was better: $2.26. The 20-year verdict isn\u2019t in yet.The most recent recession, the one that started in February 2020, led to excellent stock returns quickly, despite the initial losses. After one year, $1 had grown to $1.31; after three years, it was $1.41. I\u2019m betting that it will keep rising over the next couple of decades, but there is no guarantee that it will.The TakeawayHistory is informative, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily predict the future. These historical returns may not be echoed closely enough to serve as a reliable guide. If the stock market performs much better than it has in the past, wonderful. If it\u2019s worse, you may still be all right if you are well diversified, with holdings in markets around the globe.That said, as long as the economy keeps growing despite periodic recessions, and as long as markets operate relatively smoothly, there are grounds for both optimism and caution. While I\u2019m a confirmed investor, I don\u2019t risk money in the markets that I expect to need in the next three to five years.For safety, I hold cash in a variety of places, including government money market funds and federally insured savings accounts. Bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills are good options, too.\nFor the long haul, I invest in bonds as well as stocks in broad, diversified, low-cost index funds that mirror the entire world markets, spreading my risks. Tech stocks faltered, but energy stocks gained last year. Bonds performed miserably, but I expect they will be better in the years ahead. We\u2019ll see about all of that.Waiting many months for recession declarations, or relying on economists or Wall Street pundits to determine when to invest and what to hold all seem fruitless to me.I\u2019ll try to make sure that whatever happens, I can pay the bills first.Then, I\u2019ll continue making optimistic bets that over stretches of a couple of decades or more that the stock market will be higher than it is now, even after including those dreaded recessions.",

	"text": "Stocks slumped on Tuesday, as fears about the health of the financial sector after the collapse of First Republic Bank collided with broader anxiety stemming from signs of a weakening economy.Some regional banks, which have been under pressure since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed in March, took sizable hits on Tuesday, shattering the relative calm that prevailed after First Republic was seized and sold to JPMorgan Chase by regulators on Monday.PacWest\u2019s stock lost almost 30 percent of its value, its worst single-day drop since the height of the banking turmoil in March. Western Alliance sank about 15 percent, while Comerica and Zions also suffered double-digit percentage declines.The moves came alongside data showing U.S. manufacturers received fewer new orders than expected in March and a continued cooling of the labor market that month, with job openings falling and layoffs rising. Oil prices fell sharply, too, as the prospects of an economic downturn would likely cut energy demand. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped to around $75, near its lowest level for the year.\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent. Energy stocks fell by the most, with the sector as a whole down more than 4 percent, followed by financials, down 2.3 percent.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThe bank problem is going to be ongoing,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. \u201cThe idea that giving First Republic to JPMorgan would end this, I never believed it. There is a real fear of instability and an economic slowdown.\u201dSome investors have made bumper returns betting on the drops in bank stocks, a practice known as short selling. Metropolitan Bank has seen the biggest increase in bearish bets over the past 30 days, according to data from S3 Partners. More than 10 percent of the bank\u2019s stock is now lent to short-sellers. Nearly 20 percent of PacWest\u2019s shares are out on loan, however that number has fallen slightly over the past month.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, sought to temper concerns over the stability of the banking system on Tuesday. \u201cWe have the tools necessary to keep our banking system safe and protect depositors,\u201d she told reporters.Investors also expressed anxiety about the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank is expected to raise interest rates. The Fed has raised rates rapidly over the past year in an attempt to cool the economy and tame stubbornly high inflation. But higher rates have also been the root of the trouble at banks.\nSome investors worry that pushing rates even higher could prompt another wave of turmoil, as consumers move bank deposits, which earn relatively little in interest, to alternatives like money market funds, which offer higher returns. To retain customers, banks could offer higher interest on deposits, but that squeezes their profit margins.\u201cSo far the Fed has seemed rather obtuse,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \u201cThey are so laser-focused on inflation, which is a rearview-mirror issue, rather than being focused on the damage they could cause by hiking rates further.\u201dBased on market prices, investors still expect the Fed to increase interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday. But that conviction has weakened somewhat, with bets tilting toward cuts to rates as soon as September, an outcome that\u2019s likely only if inflation falls precipitously or the economy slides into a severe recession.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, fell almost a fifth of a point on Tuesday, to below 4 percent, a big move for an asset that usually moves by hundredths of a percentage point each day.Elsewhere, a survey of bank lending conditions published Tuesday by the European Central Bank showed lenders in the eurozone pulling back from lending at a pace faster than that of any time since the 2011 European debt crisis. Worries about a credit crunch squeezing the economy are also becoming more prominent among policymakers in the United States.Adding to the murky outlook, U.S. lawmakers have yet to agree on a deal to raise the ceiling on the amount of debt the government can take on, with administration officials warning that it could run out of money by June.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Twelve months ago, Tom Lee bet that 2023 was going to turn out just fine.While many of his peers on Wall Street were sounding the alarm over an impending economic downturn, Mr. Lee, a stock market strategist who spent more than a decade running J.P. Morgan\u2019s equity research before setting up his own firm, forecast in December 2022 that falling inflation and economic resilience would buck the broadly bearish mood.Mr. Lee was right. Despite political brinkmanship over the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, a banking crisis in March, fears over the cost of funding the government\u2019s fiscal deficit, a continuing war in Ukraine and fresh conflict in Israel, the core of Mr. Lee\u2019s prediction came to fruition in 2023. Inflation has fallen, unemployment remains low, and the S&P 500 has risen 25 percent.Most investors disagreed with Mr. Lee\u2019s prognosis; in 2023, they pulled more than $70 billion out of funds that buy U.S. stocks, according to data from EPFR Global. Only a quarter of fund managers whose performance is benchmarked to the S&P 500 have beaten the index\u2019s returns this year, according to Morningstar Direct.\u201c2023 was a year that people were so convinced we would have a recession and they looked at everything through that lens,\u201d said Mr. Lee, head of research for Fundstrat. \u201cThen there were folks like us that said we don\u2019t know the future but there is little evidence a recession is coming.\u201d\nHeading into 2024, prognosticators tracked by Bloomberg share Mr. Lee\u2019s optimism more broadly, including analysts at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Binky Chadha, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank who bet against the consensus with Mr. Lee last year, is also predicting that the bull rally will continue.At the same time, analysts at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and others maintain that the absence of a severe downturn in 2023 doesn\u2019t mean it has been avoided altogether, since the full effect of higher interest rates is still working through the economy.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThere are a lot of things that have to go right to still come out the other side unscathed,\u201d said Mike Wilson, chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He revised his bearish bets in July, although even then he didn\u2019t budge from his stance that the economy would worsen.Central to both views is the path of inflation and whether the Federal Reserve can return the pace of price rises back to its target of 2 percent before the economy sputters.The Fed began putting the brakes on the economy in March 2022 by raising interest rates. But the central bank has recently appeared confident that it is getting close to its target. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.1 percent over the year through November, down from a peak of over 9 percent through June 2022. Core C.P.I., which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remains at 4 percent.\nThe sooner the Fed gets to its target, the sooner it can start to take its foot off the brakes of the economy. The central bank recently forecast lower interest rates next year. Even without rate cuts, falling inflation and historically high wage growth could embolden consumers to keep spending, offering a tailwind for corporate profits to soar even higher, Mr. Lee said.\nOthers are less confident. While the labor market remains strong, recent months have shown early signs of weakness, with a modest rise in unemployment as more people begin seeking work. Credit card delinquencies and the number of people overdue on car loan repayments are also rising, as investors note that consumer finances have become more stretched after the repeal of plans to forgive student loan debt. With inflation still above the Fed\u2019s target, these cracks could widen in the coming year.Jason Hunter, an equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, said the market appeared to be ignoring an expected slowdown in growth next year. \u201cThe equity market looks like it is priced for a very rosy outcome,\u201d he said.While the service side of the economy, such as restaurants, has held up well this year, manufacturing has struggled after a stretch of overproduction in 2022.\nEnergy stocks remain negative for the year, after being the standout performer in 2022. Utilities stocks \u2014 typically a haven when other parts of the market are in turmoil, thanks to their steady income stream \u2014 have fallen more than 10 percent since January. Smaller companies, too, have languished, with the Russell 2000 index still roughly 15 percent off its previous peak and18 percent higher for the year.For Mr. Lee and the growing herd of market bulls, these unloved areas of the market offer an opportunity in 2024. A turn in the manufacturing slump, as companies work through the backlog of inventories and begin placing new orders, could help companies that struggled in 2023 catch up.Mr. Chadha of Deutsche Bank noted that economists had consistently underappreciated the amount of growth in the economy this year. He thinks it\u2019s likely to happen again.\u201cWe think we will get positive-growth surprises that will propel equities higher,\u201d he said.Those who are more bearish say that a manufacturing recovery is far from assured and that the slide in those sectors of the market in 2023 could be a warning that if it weren\u2019t for a few behemoth technology stocks that lifted the S&P 500 higher, the stock rally would look very different.These tech stocks have been so dominant, they even earned themselves the nickname the Magnificent Seven. It\u2019s a group that boasts some of the biggest companies in the market: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. Without them, the S&P 500 would have risen around 10 percent this year.\n\u201cIf average companies don\u2019t see an improvement, that to me is the risk of a hard landing,\u201d Mr. Wilson of Morgan Stanley said. \u201cIf we are going to have a recession, it\u2019ll be when these businesses decide to start letting people go.\u201dFor Mr. Lee, history suggests a different outcome. When the S&P 500 has risen by at least 15 percent for the year, which has happened 28 times back to 1950, the index has risen by another 10 percent the next year half the time, and is positive over 70 percent of the time, he said. And when interest rates have previously been between 3 and 5 percent, the valuation of the stock market has been similar to what it is now, suggesting the rally isn\u2019t overdone.\u201cPeople are trying to be too theoretical about the stock market,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cThe acceptance of chaos is a more correct way to approach the market.\u201d",

And Berkshire\u2019s cash stake swelled to a record $157.2 billion in the third quarter, when it sold $5.3 billion more stocks than it bought.Berkshire also slowed repurchases of its own stock, buying back $1.1 billion in the third quarter.Investors watch Berkshire closely because its results often reflect broader economic trends and because of Mr. Buffett\u2019s reputation as a savvy investor.The third-quarter net loss more than quadrupled to $12.77 billion from about $2.8 billion a year earlier.\nResults included $23.5 billion in losses from investments, primarily reflecting a 12 percent decline in the stock price of Apple, in which Berkshire owned a $157 billion stake, as of Sept 30.Berkshire\u2019s net results swing widely from quarter to quarter because accounting rules require the company to report investment gains and losses even if it buys and sells nothing. Mr. Buffett says the resulting volatility is usually meaningless.Operating profit rose 41 percent to $10.76 billion from $7.65 billion a year earlier.Insurance operations generated $4.89 billion of profit, as the Geico car insurer and reinsurance businesses made money after posting losses in 2022, while rising interest rates boosted income generated from U.S. Treasuries.Berkshire also benefited from a relatively quiet Atlantic hurricane season, which reduced catastrophe losses, unlike in 2022 when it lost $2.7 billion from Hurricane Ian.But revenues at its BNSF freight railroad were down 15.3 percent in the quarter on lower volumes and higher non-fuel expenses. Its businesses tied to the housing market also saw declines because of rising mortgage interest rates and fewer existing homes for sale as well as a drop in demand for mortgage refinancing. Revenues from its real estate brokerage business declined 13.8 percent in the third quarter.\nBerkshire also reported that revenues from its apparel and footwear businesses fell 11.2 percent on a decline in customer demand.Mr. Buffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965.

	"text": "It isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s more important than ever.I\u2019m talking about the 60/40 portfolio, which has sometimes been considered the living heart of investing. Those specific numbers \u2014 which refer to 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds as core investment holdings \u2014 aren\u2019t significant. They are merely a convenient starting point for thinking about investing and not an exact, general-purpose prescription for everyone. Nor have they ever been.But they do represent a fundamental principle. While it\u2019s more complicated, it comes down to this: Don\u2019t keep your eggs in one basket. Diversify rigorously and systematically among stocks and bonds, and do it for the long haul.The claim that this concept is dead doesn\u2019t make sense. Diversification in investing is as important now as it ever was, even if it hasn\u2019t paid off lately.But what is true is that both stocks and bonds performed poorly over much of the last two years, especially in 2022. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates led to bond losses along with a drop in the stock market. If you held a broad portfolio of stocks and bonds in 2022 \u2014 whether your mix was 60/40 or some other variant \u2014 you probably lost money. Neither the stocks nor the bonds helped.\nThat was awful. But the solution isn\u2019t to abandon diversification. It is to stick with it, and maybe even diversify further.The Core ConceptHarry Markowitz was a giant of finance. He was also an earthy Chicagoan, who told me back in 2012 that he was comfortable with using eggs in a basket to describe his work, for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1990.\u201cWhat I did was a lot fancier than that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needed a lot of math.\u201d But the basic concept is that if all of your investments are the same and something bad happens to any one of them, you will be in, let us say, deep trouble. Don\u2019t let that happen to you.Harry died in June. In 2012, he explained how you could reduce total risk by combining a lot of individually risky assets. If their price movements are poorly or even inversely correlated \u2014 so that some rise while others fall \u2014 your portfolio will become more stable. This is the core of what has become known as \u201cmodern portfolio theory.\u201dIt emphasizes asset allocation over individual stock and bond picking, and accepting only the risk you can handle by selecting your investment mix along what he called \u201can efficient frontier.\u201d \nThis gets wonky, but in simple terms, he advised setting up your portfolio for the long haul, so you could ignore the constant financial crises that obsess so many people on Wall Street. Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Is the market up or down today? Don\u2019t even think about it. That\u2019s advice that I have taken to heart.Now, though, this core approach to investing has come under criticism. Why? The stock market, as represented by the S&P 500, lost 18 percent in 2022. The bond market, defined by a popular benchmark, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, lost 13 percent. Diversification didn\u2019t protect you in 2022.Popularizing 60/40Benjamin Graham, the Columbia University finance professor who taught Warren Buffett about value investing, suggested, in various editions of \u201cThe Intelligent Investor,\u201d that a stock and bond portfolio should be at least 20 percent stock and perhaps as much as 80 percent. He settled on a 50/50 split, not 60/40, as a reasonable starting point, altering the stock allocation depending on market conditions.But 60/40 became reasonably popular late in the 20th century. Peter L. Bernstein, the economic historian, once explained the logic of a 60/40 allocation this way: Long-term investors should favor the stock market over bonds because stocks have a higher ceiling, but bonds are a balm because they are safer. So tilt toward stock, while holding a lot of bonds, leaving a 60/40 allocation, as a starting point.\nJohn C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and the creator of the first commercially available, broad, low-cost index funds, popularized the 60/40 portfolio as much as anybody when he created the Vanguard Balanced fund \u2014 a simple 60/40 blend of a broad Vanguard U.S. stock fund and a U.S. bond fund. (It lost almost 17 percent in 2022.)Even Jack, as he insisted I call him, said 60/40 wasn\u2019t the only way to go. Vanguard\u2019s oldest fund is a balanced fund, the Wellington Fund, and it contains 65 percent stock and 35 percent bonds. Other Vanguard funds have different allocations. All had big losses in 2022 but have done well over long periods.So what mix is ideal? I don\u2019t know. One notion is to hold more stock when you are young and more bonds as you age, though Jack himself didn\u2019t do that. He was a risk taker, and held well more than 60 percent stock in his personal portfolio, he told me, when he was well into his 80s.The important issue isn\u2019t whether a 60/40 portfolio mix is best. It may not be. But all traditional balanced portfolios are mixtures of stocks and bonds seeking to lower risk through diversification. And they are all open to the main complaint. Diversification didn\u2019t work well in 2022.A Bigger UniverseOne answer is to diversify even further. The Vanguard Balanced and Wellington funds are both U.S.-only funds. But modern portfolio theory suggests that you hold a piece of the entire investable publicly traded stock and bond universe.\nIn other words, go global. Use low-cost index funds (or actively managed funds, if that\u2019s your preference) that range across the whole planet. That\u2019s the approach I take and that academic finance generally recommends.It hasn\u2019t helped, though, if your goal is to minimize losses and maximize gains. The U.S. stock and bond markets have outperformed the rest of the world\u2019s markets for years. At some point, I assume that this will turn around and that global diversification will pay off in the long run, as academic theory suggests. But it hasn\u2019t been a satisfying solution lately.Another option is to expand beyond stocks and bonds. The safest alternative is probably cash, which includes Treasury bills and money-market funds.They have been stellar performers, now that the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates above 5 percent in its battle against inflation. Increasing cash holdings and substituting money-market funds for some of your longer-term bonds has been an effective tactical move over the last year or two, and cash may be considered part of a core, classic portfolio, though getting the timing right is tricky.Shifting between cash and longer-term fixed-income holdings requires you to closely pay attention to interest rates and know when to move in and out of longer-term fixed-income holdings. It\u2019s hard to get that right.\nAnother possibility is to tweak your fixed-income holdings in terms of duration, credit quality and nationality, though indexed investment-grade holdings of bonds denominated in your home currency \u2014 dollars, if you are American \u2014 may be all you really need.Readjustments like these can be appropriate for classic, core investment portfolios.But that\u2019s about as far as I would go.AlternativesThere are many other tempting alternatives.Even those who favor core stock and bond portfolios have sometimes called for adding other asset classes \u2014 like gold or real estate \u2014 to basic diversified investments, though some studies have shown that they provide minimal protection, at best.There\u2019s no shortage of reports from asset management firms arguing that hedge funds and private equity funds need to be added into the intelligent investor\u2019s mix. And you can also delve into futures and options that can limit your losses, at a cost. Once you\u2019ve started down this route, why not go further afield? Cryptocurrency: People in the industry claim that it\u2019s an asset class and should be represented in your portfolio.I\u2019ve not seen solid evidence that any of these things are needed as core investments. As a proxy for a plain vanilla 60/40 U.S.-oriented portfolio, consider Jack Bogle\u2019s humble Vanguard Balanced fund. True, its return was terrible in 2022: minus 17 percent. But since its inception in 1992, it has gained 7.8 percent annualized, or a cumulative 900 percent. Over the last 12 months, it\u2019s up almost 10 percent. There\u2019s nothing broken about any of that.\nStocks and bonds, for the most part, are not declining in tandem this year. Diversification seems to be working again.Of course, I can\u2019t say what will happen in the future, and, clearly, the core approach won\u2019t protect you from losses all the time. But no one ever promised that it would.Keep your costs low, invest broadly \u2014 and stick with it. It\u2019s a simple approach and a proven one. Despite painful lurches, there are good reasons to believe that it will work for years to come.",

	"text": "It was a great year for the stock market and for the vast majority of investors in workplace retirement accounts.But let\u2019s not get carried away.Even after the 2023 gains, most stock investors are only barely above water since the start of 2022. It looks better when you include dividends. Then, the S&P 500 returned 3.42 percent over the course of the two calendar years. Even so, the paltry stock market increases haven\u2019t kept up with inflation.If you can stand the pain, recall the simultaneous declines in the stock and bond markets that made 2022 a terrible year for investors. It was arguably even worse than 2008, when the stock market collapsed during the great financial crisis. In 2022, bonds declined sharply in value as interest rates rose, while during the financial crisis, investment-grade bonds rallied as interest rates declined.Lately, the markets have been much kinder to investors, with both stocks and bonds holding their own.The good returns for 2023 are thanks in no small part to the brilliant performance of the last three months of the year \u2014 fueled by growing expectations that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession, and that the Federal Reserve will soon begin to cut short-term interest rates.\nThe final quarterly and annual numbers for 2023 were exceptionally good. They translate into substantial annual gains for millions of investors who hold stocks and bonds indirectly, through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and trusts, often in workplace retirement accounts.So if you have held broadly diversified investments that track the markets, endured the bad times of 2022 and persevered through 2023, you are probably doing OK. You may even be slightly ahead of where your portfolio stood at the start of 2022.Good TidingsLet\u2019s review the good times of late 2023.The S&P 500, which tracks the most valuable stocks in the U.S. market, rose 11.2 percent in the last quarter \u2014 and had a total return of 11.7 percent, including dividends. For the year, it gained 24.2 percent and returned 26.3 percent, including dividends.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Broader U.S. stock indexes, like the Russell 3000, the FT Wilshire 5000 and the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index, which include smaller stocks as well as the giants in the S&P 500, also had a total return of around 26 percent for 2023.Rank-and-file fund investors shared in most of those gains, the database maintained by Morningstar, the financial service company, shows. The average U.S. domestic stock mutual fund and exchange-traded fund returned 11.3 percent for the fourth quarter and 20.3 percent for the year.\nNote that the average fund substantially lagged the broad stock market averages. Most funds are actively managed, by professionals trying to beat the market. By contrast, broad low-cost index funds, which merely seek to mirror the markets, generally did their job well.For example, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund returned 12.3 percent for the quarter and 26.1 percent for the year, beating the average fund as well as the S&P 500. That, in a nutshell, is why I believe it\u2019s better for most people to use low-cost index funds.Most global markets also did well in 2023 \u2014 and, as usual, the average fund trailed the market returns. For example, an important global benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index (often known as ACWI) returned more than 21 percent in 2023. The average international fund in the Morningstar database returned only 14.3 percent Of course, some individual stocks did much better than average. Nvidia, which makes advanced computer chips, rose 239 percent in 2023. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, gained 194 percent, after falling 64 percent the previous year on investor skepticism about the company\u2019s focus, back then, on the so-called metaverse. In 2023, though, these big tech stocks benefited from the artificial intelligence frenzy and lifted the S&P 500. Perhaps more surprising, cruise lines surged, too: Royal Caribbean soared 162 percent, and Carnival rose 130 percent. If you had focused on any of these stocks at the start of 2023, you would have been winner.Then again, most stocks underperformed the averages. Dollar General, Moderna and Est\u00e9e Lauder, all important S&P 500 stocks, lost more than 40 percent in 2023.\nStock picking and market timing are tricky and time-consuming. I avoid both practices and seek utterly average market returns, which are better than most active traders obtain.Enduring Bond LossesThe picture for bonds improved, too, but with a major caveat. Many people who traded bonds or held bond funds since the start of 2022 haven\u2019t yet recovered their losses.While those who bought and held individual investment-grade bonds in 2022 have done just fine, the performance of bond funds wasn\u2019t nearly good enough to make up for the declines of the previous year.When interest rates rise, as they did in 2022, bond prices fall. Bond fund returns are a combination of income and price changes, and in 2022, the price declines far outweighed the income.Fortunately for investors, that changed in 2023. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index, a widely followed benchmark for investment-grade bonds and core bond funds, returned 5.5 percent for the year, according to FactSet. But the losses in 2022 were so great that over two years, the Aggregate Bond index was still down 8.2 percent, and so were many bond funds.\nIt was even worse for longer-duration bonds. Because of the way bond math works, when interest rates rise, they lose more in price than shorter-term bonds. One proxy for longer-term bonds, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, rose 2.8 percent for 2023, yet it was still down more than 29 percent for the two years combined.The fixed-income universe is enormous. I\u2019ll return to it in future columns. But the lesson here is that while bond funds are usually steadier and safer than stock funds, that\u2019s not always the case. It depends on when you\u2019re investing, and in which bonds.So Now What?Interest rates, inflation, and the strength of the economy are key factors for both stocks and bonds.It would be good to know in advance how all these things will play out.But we don\u2019t know, and nobody forecasts well enough to rely on these predictions for investing, year in and year out.Fortunately, to prosper as an investor, it\u2019s not necessary to know what will happen in the world in the next several months or years.\nFrom a longer perspective, I\u2019d say that what we\u2019ve been experiencing over the last couple of years looks a lot like mean reversion \u2014 the markets pulling themselves back into their customary, long-term upward trajectory, after terrible trials. Expect more of the same: periodic bouts of market misery, interspersed with stretches of gains, giving long-term, low-cost, buy-and-hold investors handsome returns, if they have the strength to hang on during a tumultuous ride.I base that assertion on history. Including the final tally for 2023, the average annual return for the S&P 500 since 1926 has been 10.4 percent. That means it has taken less than seven years, on average, for the U.S. stock market to double in value.Getting those kinds of returns in the future isn\u2019t a sure thing. They certainly won\u2019t be pain-free.Precisely because there are no guarantees, this decades-long strategy won\u2019t work when your horizon is short, as many older readers have pointed out. In that situation, locking in returns at the relatively high interest rates that prevail at the moment makes more sense than a long-term, \u201cset it and forget it\u201d approach.Whatever your investing horizon, enjoy these better times in the markets but be prudent. The losses of 2022 provided a vivid reminder of how important it is to set up your portfolio so you can tolerate market agony. Hope the current calm continues but be ready for trouble, whenever it comes.",

	"text": "Last week, the Federal Reserve held off raising interest rates after 10 increases in a row, instead waiting to assess how the economy has responded to the sharp rise in rates so far. This week, stock investors also paused for reflection, putting the recent rally on hold until the outlook becomes clearer.The S&P 500 recorded its first weekly decline since early May, ending the index\u2019s longest streak of gains since 2021. The S&P 500 has risen roughly 13 percent this year, and more than 20 percent since hitting its low point in October last year, crossing a technical threshold for the start of a bull market, a term used by Wall Street to describe a period of investing enthusiasm. Even after a slump on Friday, this week\u2019s fall shaved off just 1.4 percent from the index\u2019s previous gains.Stocks of smaller companies more exposed to the risk of a slump in the U.S. economy fell further. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks these domestically focused companies, has fallen every day this week and racked up a loss of 2.9 percent for the week \u2014 its worst since the turmoil in the banking sector in March.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.A more cautious, subdued tone to the past week\u2019s trading reflected the message delivered by Fed officials: More rate increases may be necessary, further raising costs for consumers and companies, but decisions will be guided by signals from the economy in upcoming data releases on inflation, jobs and other indicators. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during congressional testimony on Thursday that \u201cthe data will tell us what to do\u201d on future rate increases.\nIn other words, both Fed policymakers and investors are waiting for more information to decide whether interest rates will continue to rise, which will in turn guide how the stock market reacts.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cMarkets and the Fed are looking at the same data and having the same thoughts,\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cThey haven\u2019t often been on the same page this year.\u201dLast week, the Fed acknowledged that the economy had proved more resilient than expected to the central bank\u2019s attempts to slow it down and cool inflation as a result. This week, investors appeared to acknowledge that the economy\u2019s strength may warrant higher rates: For months, investors have questioned the Fed\u2019s resolve to keep raising rates, helping propel stocks upward.Investor bets on the number of rate increases by the Fed this year have nudged higher, with investors now expecting one more quarter-point increase by the end of the year. That is still less than policymakers\u2019 own forecast, which calls for two increases this year, but it\u2019s closer than it has been in the past: Until recently, investors thought the Fed might cut rates at the end of the year.The remaining disagreement, some investors say, stems from the caution that some Fed officials have expressed about the outlook. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, had supported previous rate increases. But this week, he said that he expected to hold rates where they were now through the end of the year.\nElsewhere, other central banks continued their rate-raising campaigns this week, with the Bank of England and Norway\u2019s Norges Bank surprising investors with bigger-than-expected moves.Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments, said that the market and the Fed \u201chave arrived at the same interpretation of the world,\u201d which warrants a wait-and-see approach. What happens next depends on how quickly inflation falls, and \u201cthe pace of disinflation has been so uncertain so far,\u201d she said.Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Gains in the U.S. stock market this year have been concentrated among a handful of immensely valuable tech companies. Technology and communications services stocks in the S&P 500 are up more than 30 percent this year to date. Consumer discretionary stocks are up this year as well \u2014 by around 18 percent \u2014 but all of the other eight S&P 500 sectors are down. Stocks in the energy sector are collectively down more than 10 percent.Of the S&P 500\u2019s 10.3 percent total return including dividends so far this year, 9.99 percentage points owe to just eight stocks, two of which represent parts of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, \u201cleaving a mere 0.3 percent return for the entire rest of the market,\u201d JoAnne Feeney, a portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management in Ridgewood, N.J., wrote heading into the Memorial Day weekend.What is the hypernarrow stock market advance telling us about prospects for the economy, and should we pay attention? I can tell a pessimistic story and an optimistic story, but I\u2019m going to lean into the optimism.The pessimistic take is that it\u2019s unhealthy for a market \u2014 and an economy \u2014 when all the good news is concentrated in a handful of sectors. \u201cIt can reflect overcrowding in one area and uncertainty around the broader economy in others,\u201d Mona Mahajan, a senior investment strategist at the brokerage firm Edward Jones, wrote last week.\nStock prices reflect investors\u2019 expectations about corporate profits, and profits are tied to the performance of the economy. So there should be \u2014 and is \u2014 a positive correlation between the stock market and the economic outlook. But the performance of particular sectors also reflects factors that are unique to those sectors: oil prices, interest rates, tech breakthroughs and so on.The artificial intelligence craze is the most likely explanation for the tech sector\u2019s outperformance this year. That seems like a slender reed on which to build a broad economic expansion.But it\u2019s not so unusual for one or two sectors to power an expansion. In 1980, seven of the top 10 S&P 500 members by market cap were in energy, according to data compiled by Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Assume for the moment that only the tech sector benefits from A.I. Diversified investors still benefit from the A.I. craze because a big portion of their portfolios is in tech stocks. The people who get hired to work on A.I. also benefit. Some of them may transition into tech from sectors that aren\u2019t doing as well. Meanwhile, rising stock prices induce more consumer spending.The S&P 500 index is capitalization-weighted, meaning that the most valuable companies carry more weight. A change of 1 percent in the price of Apple shares affects the index more than the same change in the price of the 500th-most-valuable index member. You can make a case that the economy is also weighted, although not by market value: The performance of a big, powerful sector such as tech matters more to gross domestic product and even employment than the performance of, say, the materials sector.\nEven that understates the potential gains from A.I. and other tech advances. Economic historians point out that while companies on the leading edge of technology production score the early gains, over the long term most of the benefits go to the customers. Take Microsoft\u2019s Excel spreadsheet program. Sure, it\u2019s been a cash cow for Microsoft for decades. But the gains to Microsoft and its investors aren\u2019t as big as the gains to people all over the world who use Excel to run their businesses more effectively.Artificial intelligence is likely to turn out the same way as Excel. In fact, we\u2019re already seeing it. Early adopters are finding clever uses for A.I. tools such as ChatGPT, including memo drafting, language translation, software code generation and debugging. Deutsche Bank strategists recently compared A.I. with automobiles, which created jobs in not just auto production but also dealerships, road construction, tourism and the development of the suburbs.I worry about the downsides of A.I. I also worry that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession, if it isn\u2019t in one already. In spite of those concerns, I think the narrowness of the stock market\u2019s rise \u2014 so heavily driven by a handful of tech giants \u2014 isn\u2019t the problem that many strategists make it out to be.\u201cInvestor exuberance has some solid foundations,\u201d Feeney wrote. I think she\u2019s right.Elsewhere: The Minimum Wage Is Pretty MinimalThe buying power of the federal minimum wage is at its lowest point since December 1949, according to a calculation by the Economic Policy Institute. The wage floor has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since July 2009, the longest period without change in its history. Its buying power has been eroded by inflation. In December 1949, the minimum wage was 40 cents an hour, or $4.48 in April 2023 dollars. It rose to 75 cents the next month, which is $8.44 in April 2023 dollars. At its peak value, in February 1968, the minimum wage was worth $12.44 in April 2023 dollars.\nTo adjust for inflation, the Economic Policy Institute splices together several price indexes to make up for the fact that the CPI-U \u2014 the price index for all urban consumers \u2014 isn\u2019t defined consistently over time. Today\u2019s minimum wage would appear even lower, going strictly by the CPI-U, which is what the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in its online inflation calculator.Quote of the Day\u201cA human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

	"text": "Stocks rose for a second day on Tuesday, with shares of regional lenders sharply higher, as investors awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on whether it will hold off on further interest rate increases that have already shaken the financial system.The S&P 500 index rose 1.3 percent, in step with markets in Europe and Asia.Bank shares rallied, as Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen expressed confidence in the nation\u2019s banks on Tuesday and suggested that the government would step in to protect smaller banks if needed. Some lawmakers in Washington are discussing ways to raise the limit for federal deposit insurance above $250,000, possibly by temporarily increasing the cap on accounts that are used for activities like payroll.Already, financial markets had begun to settle on Monday after measures were taken to shore up Europe\u2019s banks, with Swiss regulators orchestrating the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.\u201cThe signal of confidence is what is most important,\u201d analysts at Wells Fargo noted, referring to the deal.First Republic Bank, the regional lender that has become the focus of Wall Street\u2019s concerns about the U.S. banking system, rose more than 29 percent in afternoon trading, a heady gain that nonetheless recovered only a small fraction of the value of its beaten-down shares. First Republic\u2019s stock has still fallen about 90 percent this month, erasing tens of billions of dollars in market value.\nThe bank has been entertaining some possible buyers after a $30 billion cash infusion from the country\u2019s largest banks failed to restore confidence among investors. Analysts at Morningstar \u201cstruggle with why a buyer would be motivated to step in, except perhaps if it were being pushed for by regulators,\u201d they wrote in a new report about First Republic\u2019s prospects.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Still, investors took solace from the authorities\u2019 support. An index that tracks the largest banks in Europe, which have been swept up in the turmoil after U.S. regulators seized two midsize lenders, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, jumped 4 percent. UBS gained 12 percent in Switzerland.Shares of other regional banks also rose. Zions Bancorporation gained 7 percent, while PacWest Bancorp jumped nearly 19 percent, and Western Alliance rallied about 15 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.However, investors said the current calm might portend a storm. A critical question, particularly for those worried about the effects of higher interest rates on banks\u2019 balance sheets, is what the Fed will do when its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, meets this week.Higher interest rates have helped slow the economy and lower stubborn inflation, but they have also raised costs for companies and contributed to the instability in the banking sector. Lower rates could support the banks, but at the risk of letting inflation get out of control.\n\u201cThe competing objectives of continuing the campaign to re-establish price stability while ensuring against further banking sector contagion has presented a meaningful challenge to the F.O.M.C.,\u201d analysts at BMO Capital Markets wrote.Before stress in the banking system erupted, investors were braced for an increase of half a percentage point in interest rates. Now, the consensus is for a quarter-point increase, while some investors and economists believe that the Fed might not raise rates at all.The uncertainty shows just how quickly the banking crisis has upended views in the markets. A few weeks ago, the question was whether the Fed would ramp up the pace of its interest rate increases. Now, traders are betting on a series of rate cuts beginning in the summer.Economists have begun to warn that the trouble in the financial system could weigh on the broader economy, if lenders begin to pull back as they look to shore up their own finances.\u201cRecent events strengthen our conviction that a recession remains the most likely outcome for the economy over the next year,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote.That is not necessarily a bad thing for markets, as analysts at Bank of America pointed out that a gauge of investor pessimism had plumbed depths associated with the low point in markets during previous cycles. In addition to the recent gains for stocks, oil prices and yields on government bonds \u2014 two key measures of concerns about the economy \u2014 rose for a second session on Tuesday.",

	"text": "Stocks in China tumbled and the currency weakened on Monday after the country\u2019s central bank announced a smaller-than-expected cut in a key interest rate.Many investors and economists had been expecting Beijing to act more decisively on interest rates as China faces falling housing prices, weak consumer spending and broad debt troubles.The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, shaved only a tenth of a percentage point off the benchmark one-year interest rate used for most corporate loans, with no change at all in the five-year rate used for pricing mortgages. The slight reduction for one-year loans was the second time in two months that the government had pushed down commercial banks\u2019 lending rates.The modest scale of the cut on Monday was the latest sign that the government\u2019s usual tools for addressing an economic slowdown may have lost some of their effectiveness, economists said.\n\u201cThis will provide only modest support to credit growth and wider economic activity,\u201d Capital Economics, a London research firm, said in a note.\nGlobal investment banks have rushed to reduce their forecasts of the Chinese economy\u2019s growth, for which Beijing has a target this year of \u201caround 5 percent.\u201d UBS announced on Monday, shortly before the interest rate cut, that it was lowering its expectations for growth to 4.8 percent this year and 4.2 percent next year. Nomura of Japan is even gloomier, predicting on Friday that growth will be 4.6 percent this year while keeping its forecast for next year at 3.9 percent.The CSI 300 index of large Chinese companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 1.4 percent on Monday, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, which also includes many large Chinese companies, tumbled 1.8 percent to its lowest level since November. The Hang Seng has fallen for seven consecutive sessions and is down more than 12 percent in August.The renminbi closed weaker than 7.3 to the dollar on Monday in Shanghai trading, a level that the Chinese government tried to maintain last November, when the currency was at its weakest since 2007. It weakened even more on Monday in Hong Kong, where trading is less tightly controlled. It took more than 7.335 renminbi to buy $1 by midafternoon there.\nThe authorities in Beijing use the country\u2019s cash reserves and state-controlled banks to buy and sell currencies in an effort to limit moves in the renminbi\u2019s value against the dollar.The renminbi suddenly rebounded a bit in the final minutes of Shanghai and Hong Kong trading. The Chinese government has a long history of intervening in currency markets at the end of trading sessions to prevent closing prices from showing sharp changes.As a result, many investors view intraday movements of the renminbi, which is also known as the yuan, as a truer measure of its value.\u201cThe intraday shows you the direction the market wants to take the yuan, and the close is more likely to show you the government\u2019s action,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics in London.The rate cut announced on Monday was intended to make it a little cheaper for companies and households to borrow money and to make payments on existing loans. But the full effect of the reduction may be delayed because the interest rates on most loans are reset annually, often at the start of each year.\nThe central bank, in consultation with state-controlled commercial banks, reduced the one-year benchmark interest rate for corporate loans to 3.45 percent, from 3.55 percent. The benchmark interest rate for five-year loans stayed at 4.2 percent.A survey of 35 economists by Reuters last week showed that all of them expected the central bank to reduce interest rates for five-year loans as well as one-year loans. Last week, the central bank lowered borrowing costs for commercial banks by 0.15 percentage points. By making a more modest cut in the one-year lending rate and leaving the five-year rate untouched, policymakers were, in effect, widening the profit margins for banks.China\u2019s commercial banks have lent enormous amounts in recent years to developers and home buyers \u2014 the same groups that have been hit hardest by China\u2019s housing crash.More than 50 developers have already defaulted or stopped payments on overseas bonds. Country Garden has become the country\u2019s largest developer to run into financial difficulties, with some $200 billion in unpaid bills.The opaque accounting of China\u2019s state-controlled financial system has made it difficult for outsiders to discern the scale of the banks\u2019 real-estate-related losses. Wider profit margins on loans could help banks accumulate more reserves to offset these losses.",

	"text": "So many people expect a recession soon that it will almost be surprising if a downturn doesn\u2019t happen.After all, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates for more than a year to tame inflation. Credit conditions have already tightened and some regional banks have failed. Although the job market is still stubbornly strong, even the staff economists at the Fed anticipate an economic slowdown that will be severe enough to count as a recession.That\u2019s particularly worrisome for investors because recessions are typically associated with double-digit stock market declines. In 2020, for example, during a bear market and recession near the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the S&P 500 dropped nearly 34 percent from its peak.Will we really have a recession this year? I don\u2019t know. But recessions are a regular part of life. Having experienced six of them in my career, along with countless up and down markets, I accept that I can\u2019t reliably forecast these important events, and neither can anyone else.\nYet I remain a constant investor anyway, mainly by keeping plenty of cash in safe places and by maintaining a resolutely long-term view that is grounded in history.It\u2019s not always easy to hang on. Uncertainty about what\u2019s coming next can make investing excruciating.But you may find some comfort from the past.Stocks have always bounced back after previous recessions, sometimes quite rapidly. Investment returns calculated at my request by Dimensional Fund Advisors, a large asset management company based in Austin, Texas, show that the market has performed reasonably well over periods of 10 or 20 years after economic downturns, if not always over shorter periods.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Calling RecessionsA recession is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,\u201d according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the quasi-official entity that declares when recessions start and stop in the United States.That sounds straightforward enough. But for a large and complex economy, determining when a recession has taken place is no simple matter, even after it has happened.\nThe bureau doesn\u2019t rush in making these judgments.We won\u2019t know for sure that we\u2019ve had a recession until well after it\u2019s started, and, quite probably, not until long after it\u2019s ended. That\u2019s what happened for the last recession. It started in February 2020, near the beginning of the pandemic, and ended in April 2020. But the bureau waited 15 months, until July 2021, to declare that a recession had ended. \u201cEarlier determinations took between four and 21 months,\u201d the bureau says. \u201cThere is no fixed timing rule. We wait long enough so that the existence of a peak or trough is not in doubt, and until we can assign an accurate peak or trough date.\u201dOften, stocks fall before a recession starts and rise before it\u2019s over.The economic research bureau \u201cdates recessions only after they\u2019ve begun,\u201d Marlena Lee, the global head of investment solutions at Dimensional Fund Advisors, said in an email. \u201cMarkets, on the other hand, call them well in advance.\u201dHistorical ReturnsAt my request, Ms. Lee examined all 11 U.S. recessions since 1948 and calculated the S&P 500\u2019s annualized total returns, including dividends, starting with the first day of the month after the recession started.I find these averages reassuring:One year after the starting dates, the S&P 500 returned 6.4 percent.Three years after the starting dates, it returned 12.1 percent.Five years later, it returned 10.4 percent.Ten years later, it returned 12 percent.Twenty years later, it returned 11.5 percent.Consider that, with compounding, $1 in the index would be worth $10.56 after 20 years, on average. So far, so good.Now for the caveats.These are only long-term averages, and there are big variations among them.The best 20-year return, which occurred in the two decades starting in February 1980, was 17.2 percent, annualized. That would transform $1 into $24.02 after 20 years.\nThe worst 20-year return, in the decades starting in May 1960, was 7.3 percent annualized. That would have changed $1 into $4.09 after 20 years.Obviously, I\u2019d rather have $24.02 in my pocket but even $4.09 would have represented a sizable gain.Nasty LossesThe variation in returns was much greater over shorter periods. One year after the recession of 1953, for example, an investment in the S&P 500 would have gained nearly 32 percent.But some years were truly painful. The stock market was still down one year after the start of three recessions, in 1973, 1981 and 2007. The last of those was the financial crisis, and it was the worst.One year after that recession began, the S&P 500, with dividends, was down 37 percent. Another way of putting it is that if you put $1 into the index at the start of the recession, it shrank to just 63 cents one year later.\nAfter three years, you were still in a hole: Your dollar had grown to just 92 cents. After five years, in 2012, you were ahead, but not by much. Your dollar was $1.09. The total at the 10-year mark in 2017 was better: $2.26. The 20-year verdict isn\u2019t in yet.The most recent recession, the one that started in February 2020, led to excellent stock returns quickly, despite the initial losses. After one year, $1 had grown to $1.31; after three years, it was $1.41. I\u2019m betting that it will keep rising over the next couple of decades, but there is no guarantee that it will.The TakeawayHistory is informative, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily predict the future. These historical returns may not be echoed closely enough to serve as a reliable guide. If the stock market performs much better than it has in the past, wonderful. If it\u2019s worse, you may still be all right if you are well diversified, with holdings in markets around the globe.That said, as long as the economy keeps growing despite periodic recessions, and as long as markets operate relatively smoothly, there are grounds for both optimism and caution. While I\u2019m a confirmed investor, I don\u2019t risk money in the markets that I expect to need in the next three to five years.For safety, I hold cash in a variety of places, including government money market funds and federally insured savings accounts. Bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills are good options, too.\nFor the long haul, I invest in bonds as well as stocks in broad, diversified, low-cost index funds that mirror the entire world markets, spreading my risks. Tech stocks faltered, but energy stocks gained last year. Bonds performed miserably, but I expect they will be better in the years ahead. We\u2019ll see about all of that.Waiting many months for recession declarations, or relying on economists or Wall Street pundits to determine when to invest and what to hold all seem fruitless to me.I\u2019ll try to make sure that whatever happens, I can pay the bills first.Then, I\u2019ll continue making optimistic bets that over stretches of a couple of decades or more that the stock market will be higher than it is now, even after including those dreaded recessions.",

	"text": "Stocks slumped on Tuesday, as fears about the health of the financial sector after the collapse of First Republic Bank collided with broader anxiety stemming from signs of a weakening economy.Some regional banks, which have been under pressure since Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank failed in March, took sizable hits on Tuesday, shattering the relative calm that prevailed after First Republic was seized and sold to JPMorgan Chase by regulators on Monday.PacWest\u2019s stock lost almost 30 percent of its value, its worst single-day drop since the height of the banking turmoil in March. Western Alliance sank about 15 percent, while Comerica and Zions also suffered double-digit percentage declines.The moves came alongside data showing U.S. manufacturers received fewer new orders than expected in March and a continued cooling of the labor market that month, with job openings falling and layoffs rising. Oil prices fell sharply, too, as the prospects of an economic downturn would likely cut energy demand. The price of a barrel of Brent crude, the international benchmark, dropped to around $75, near its lowest level for the year.\nThe S&P 500 dropped 1.2 percent. Energy stocks fell by the most, with the sector as a whole down more than 4 percent, followed by financials, down 2.3 percent.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them.

Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThe bank problem is going to be ongoing,\u201d said Andrew Brenner, the head of international fixed income at National Alliance Securities. \u201cThe idea that giving First Republic to JPMorgan would end this, I never believed it. There is a real fear of instability and an economic slowdown.\u201dSome investors have made bumper returns betting on the drops in bank stocks, a practice known as short selling. Metropolitan Bank has seen the biggest increase in bearish bets over the past 30 days, according to data from S3 Partners. More than 10 percent of the bank\u2019s stock is now lent to short-sellers. Nearly 20 percent of PacWest\u2019s shares are out on loan, however that number has fallen slightly over the past month.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.Karine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, sought to temper concerns over the stability of the banking system on Tuesday. \u201cWe have the tools necessary to keep our banking system safe and protect depositors,\u201d she told reporters.Investors also expressed anxiety about the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting on Wednesday, when the central bank is expected to raise interest rates. The Fed has raised rates rapidly over the past year in an attempt to cool the economy and tame stubbornly high inflation. But higher rates have also been the root of the trouble at banks.\nSome investors worry that pushing rates even higher could prompt another wave of turmoil, as consumers move bank deposits, which earn relatively little in interest, to alternatives like money market funds, which offer higher returns. To retain customers, banks could offer higher interest on deposits, but that squeezes their profit margins.\u201cSo far the Fed has seemed rather obtuse,\u201d said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \u201cThey are so laser-focused on inflation, which is a rearview-mirror issue, rather than being focused on the damage they could cause by hiking rates further.\u201dBased on market prices, investors still expect the Fed to increase interest rates by a quarter-point on Wednesday. But that conviction has weakened somewhat, with bets tilting toward cuts to rates as soon as September, an outcome that\u2019s likely only if inflation falls precipitously or the economy slides into a severe recession.The two-year Treasury yield, which is sensitive to changes in interest rate expectations, fell almost a fifth of a point on Tuesday, to below 4 percent, a big move for an asset that usually moves by hundredths of a percentage point each day.Elsewhere, a survey of bank lending conditions published Tuesday by the European Central Bank showed lenders in the eurozone pulling back from lending at a pace faster than that of any time since the 2011 European debt crisis. Worries about a credit crunch squeezing the economy are also becoming more prominent among policymakers in the United States.Adding to the murky outlook, U.S. lawmakers have yet to agree on a deal to raise the ceiling on the amount of debt the government can take on, with administration officials warning that it could run out of money by June.Jim Tankersley contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Twelve months ago, Tom Lee bet that 2023 was going to turn out just fine.While many of his peers on Wall Street were sounding the alarm over an impending economic downturn, Mr. Lee, a stock market strategist who spent more than a decade running J.P. Morgan\u2019s equity research before setting up his own firm, forecast in December 2022 that falling inflation and economic resilience would buck the broadly bearish mood.Mr. Lee was right. Despite political brinkmanship over the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, a banking crisis in March, fears over the cost of funding the government\u2019s fiscal deficit, a continuing war in Ukraine and fresh conflict in Israel, the core of Mr. Lee\u2019s prediction came to fruition in 2023. Inflation has fallen, unemployment remains low, and the S&P 500 has risen 25 percent.Most investors disagreed with Mr. Lee\u2019s prognosis; in 2023, they pulled more than $70 billion out of funds that buy U.S. stocks, according to data from EPFR Global. Only a quarter of fund managers whose performance is benchmarked to the S&P 500 have beaten the index\u2019s returns this year, according to Morningstar Direct.\u201c2023 was a year that people were so convinced we would have a recession and they looked at everything through that lens,\u201d said Mr. Lee, head of research for Fundstrat. \u201cThen there were folks like us that said we don\u2019t know the future but there is little evidence a recession is coming.\u201d\nHeading into 2024, prognosticators tracked by Bloomberg share Mr. Lee\u2019s optimism more broadly, including analysts at Citigroup and Goldman Sachs. Binky Chadha, an equity strategist at Deutsche Bank who bet against the consensus with Mr. Lee last year, is also predicting that the bull rally will continue.At the same time, analysts at Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and others maintain that the absence of a severe downturn in 2023 doesn\u2019t mean it has been avoided altogether, since the full effect of higher interest rates is still working through the economy.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cThere are a lot of things that have to go right to still come out the other side unscathed,\u201d said Mike Wilson, chief equity strategist at Morgan Stanley. He revised his bearish bets in July, although even then he didn\u2019t budge from his stance that the economy would worsen.Central to both views is the path of inflation and whether the Federal Reserve can return the pace of price rises back to its target of 2 percent before the economy sputters.The Fed began putting the brakes on the economy in March 2022 by raising interest rates. But the central bank has recently appeared confident that it is getting close to its target. The Consumer Price Index rose 3.1 percent over the year through November, down from a peak of over 9 percent through June 2022. Core C.P.I., which excludes volatile food and energy prices, remains at 4 percent.\nThe sooner the Fed gets to its target, the sooner it can start to take its foot off the brakes of the economy. The central bank recently forecast lower interest rates next year. Even without rate cuts, falling inflation and historically high wage growth could embolden consumers to keep spending, offering a tailwind for corporate profits to soar even higher, Mr. Lee said.\nOthers are less confident. While the labor market remains strong, recent months have shown early signs of weakness, with a modest rise in unemployment as more people begin seeking work. Credit card delinquencies and the number of people overdue on car loan repayments are also rising, as investors note that consumer finances have become more stretched after the repeal of plans to forgive student loan debt. With inflation still above the Fed\u2019s target, these cracks could widen in the coming year.Jason Hunter, an equity strategist at J.P. Morgan, said the market appeared to be ignoring an expected slowdown in growth next year. \u201cThe equity market looks like it is priced for a very rosy outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.While the service side of the economy, such as restaurants, has held up well this year, manufacturing has struggled after a stretch of overproduction in 2022.\nEnergy stocks remain negative for the year, after being the standout performer in 2022. Utilities stocks \u2014 typically a haven when other parts of the market are in turmoil, thanks to their steady income stream \u2014 have fallen more than 10 percent since January. Smaller companies, too, have languished, with the Russell 2000 index still roughly 15 percent off its previous peak and18 percent higher for the year.For Mr. Lee and the growing herd of market bulls, these unloved areas of the market offer an opportunity in 2024. A turn in the manufacturing slump, as companies work through the backlog of inventories and begin placing new orders, could help companies that struggled in 2023 catch up.Mr. Chadha of Deutsche Bank noted that economists had consistently underappreciated the amount of growth in the economy this year. He thinks it\u2019s likely to happen again.\u201cWe think we will get positive-growth surprises that will propel equities higher,\u201d he said.Those who are more bearish say that a manufacturing recovery is far from assured and that the slide in those sectors of the market in 2023 could be a warning that if it weren\u2019t for a few behemoth technology stocks that lifted the S&P 500 higher, the stock rally would look very different.These tech stocks have been so dominant, they even earned themselves the nickname the Magnificent Seven. It\u2019s a group that boasts some of the biggest companies in the market: Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. Without them, the S&P 500 would have risen around 10 percent this year.\n\u201cIf average companies don\u2019t see an improvement, that to me is the risk of a hard landing,\u201d Mr. Wilson of Morgan Stanley said. \u201cIf we are going to have a recession, it\u2019ll be when these businesses decide to start letting people go.\u201dFor Mr. Lee, history suggests a different outcome. When the S&P 500 has risen by at least 15 percent for the year, which has happened 28 times back to 1950, the index has risen by another 10 percent the next year half the time, and is positive over 70 percent of the time, he said. And when interest rates have previously been between 3 and 5 percent, the valuation of the stock market has been similar to what it is now, suggesting the rally isn\u2019t overdone.\u201cPeople are trying to be too theoretical about the stock market,\u201d Mr. Lee said. \u201cThe acceptance of chaos is a more correct way to approach the market.\u201d",

	"text": "Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren Buffett, posted its first overall quarterly loss in a year on Saturday on the falling prices of Apple and other stocks it owns, though it said improvement in its insurance operations boosted operating profit to a record.Its wide-ranging portfolio of businesses, ranging from insurance to energy to consumer goods like See\u2019s candies, generally fared better in the third quarter than in the same quarter a year earlier. And Berkshire\u2019s cash stake swelled to a record $157.2 billion in the third quarter, when it sold $5.3 billion more stocks than it bought.Berkshire also slowed repurchases of its own stock, buying back $1.1 billion in the third quarter.Investors watch Berkshire closely because its results often reflect broader economic trends and because of Mr. Buffett\u2019s reputation as a savvy investor.The third-quarter net loss more than quadrupled to $12.77 billion from about $2.8 billion a year earlier.\nResults included $23.5 billion in losses from investments, primarily reflecting a 12 percent decline in the stock price of Apple, in which Berkshire owned a $157 billion stake, as of Sept 30.Berkshire\u2019s net results swing widely from quarter to quarter because accounting rules require the company to report investment gains and losses even if it buys and sells nothing. Mr. Buffett says the resulting volatility is usually meaningless.Operating profit rose 41 percent to $10.76 billion from $7.65 billion a year earlier.Insurance operations generated $4.89 billion of profit, as the Geico car insurer and reinsurance businesses made money after posting losses in 2022, while rising interest rates boosted income generated from U.S. Treasuries.Berkshire also benefited from a relatively quiet Atlantic hurricane season, which reduced catastrophe losses, unlike in 2022 when it lost $2.7 billion from Hurricane Ian.But revenues at its BNSF freight railroad were down 15.3 percent in the quarter on lower volumes and higher non-fuel expenses. Its businesses tied to the housing market also saw declines because of rising mortgage interest rates and fewer existing homes for sale as well as a drop in demand for mortgage refinancing. Revenues from its real estate brokerage business declined 13.8 percent in the third quarter.\nBerkshire also reported that revenues from its apparel and footwear businesses fell 11.2 percent on a decline in customer demand.Mr. Buffett, 93, has run Berkshire since 1965. His $117.5 billion net worth ranks fifth worldwide according to Forbes magazine.Berkshire shares are up 14 percent this year, matching the return of the S&P 500.",

	"text": "It isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s more important than ever.I\u2019m talking about the 60/40 portfolio, which has sometimes been considered the living heart of investing. Those specific numbers \u2014 which refer to 60 percent stock and 40 percent bonds as core investment holdings \u2014 aren\u2019t significant. They are merely a convenient starting point for thinking about investing and not an exact, general-purpose prescription for everyone. Nor have they ever been.But they do represent a fundamental principle. While it\u2019s more complicated, it comes down to this: Don\u2019t keep your eggs in one basket. Diversify rigorously and systematically among stocks and bonds, and do it for the long haul.The claim that this concept is dead doesn\u2019t make sense. Diversification in investing is as important now as it ever was, even if it hasn\u2019t paid off lately.But what is true is that both stocks and bonds performed poorly over much of the last two years, especially in 2022. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates led to bond losses along with a drop in the stock market. If you held a broad portfolio of stocks and bonds in 2022 \u2014 whether your mix was 60/40 or some other variant \u2014 you probably lost money. Neither the stocks nor the bonds helped.\nThat was awful. But the solution isn\u2019t to abandon diversification. It is to stick with it, and maybe even diversify further.The Core ConceptHarry Markowitz was a giant of finance. He was also an earthy Chicagoan, who told me back in 2012 that he was comfortable with using eggs in a basket to describe his work, for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1990.\u201cWhat I did was a lot fancier than that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt needed a lot of math.\u201d But the basic concept is that if all of your investments are the same and something bad happens to any one of them, you will be in, let us say, deep trouble. Don\u2019t let that happen to you.Harry died in June. In 2012, he explained how you could reduce total risk by combining a lot of individually risky assets. If their price movements are poorly or even inversely correlated \u2014 so that some rise while others fall \u2014 your portfolio will become more stable. This is the core of what has become known as \u201cmodern portfolio theory.\u201dIt emphasizes asset allocation over individual stock and bond picking, and accepting only the risk you can handle by selecting your investment mix along what he called \u201can efficient frontier.\u201d \nThis gets wonky, but in simple terms, he advised setting up your portfolio for the long haul, so you could ignore the constant financial crises that obsess so many people on Wall Street. Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Is the market up or down today? Don\u2019t even think about it. That\u2019s advice that I have taken to heart.Now, though, this core approach to investing has come under criticism. Why? The stock market, as represented by the S&P 500, lost 18 percent in 2022. The bond market, defined by a popular benchmark, the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, lost 13 percent. Diversification didn\u2019t protect you in 2022.Popularizing 60/40Benjamin Graham, the Columbia University finance professor who taught Warren Buffett about value investing, suggested, in various editions of \u201cThe Intelligent Investor,\u201d that a stock and bond portfolio should be at least 20 percent stock and perhaps as much as 80 percent. He settled on a 50/50 split, not 60/40, as a reasonable starting point, altering the stock allocation depending on market conditions.But 60/40 became reasonably popular late in the 20th century. Peter L. Bernstein, the economic historian, once explained the logic of a 60/40 allocation this way: Long-term investors should favor the stock market over bonds because stocks have a higher ceiling, but bonds are a balm because they are safer. So tilt toward stock, while holding a lot of bonds, leaving a 60/40 allocation, as a starting point.\nJohn C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard and the creator of the first commercially available, broad, low-cost index funds, popularized the 60/40 portfolio as much as anybody when he created the Vanguard Balanced fund \u2014 a simple 60/40 blend of a broad Vanguard U.S. stock fund and a U.S. bond fund. (It lost almost 17 percent in 2022.)Even Jack, as he insisted I call him, said 60/40 wasn\u2019t the only way to go. Vanguard\u2019s oldest fund is a balanced fund, the Wellington Fund, and it contains 65 percent stock and 35 percent bonds. Other Vanguard funds have different allocations. All had big losses in 2022 but have done well over long periods.So what mix is ideal? I don\u2019t know. One notion is to hold more stock when you are young and more bonds as you age, though Jack himself didn\u2019t do that. He was a risk taker, and held well more than 60 percent stock in his personal portfolio, he told me, when he was well into his 80s.The important issue isn\u2019t whether a 60/40 portfolio mix is best. It may not be. But all traditional balanced portfolios are mixtures of stocks and bonds seeking to lower risk through diversification. And they are all open to the main complaint. Diversification didn\u2019t work well in 2022.A Bigger UniverseOne answer is to diversify even further. The Vanguard Balanced and Wellington funds are both U.S.-only funds. But modern portfolio theory suggests that you hold a piece of the entire investable publicly traded stock and bond universe.\nIn other words, go global. Use low-cost index funds (or actively managed funds, if that\u2019s your preference) that range across the whole planet. That\u2019s the approach I take and that academic finance generally recommends.It hasn\u2019t helped, though, if your goal is to minimize losses and maximize gains. The U.S. stock and bond markets have outperformed the rest of the world\u2019s markets for years. At some point, I assume that this will turn around and that global diversification will pay off in the long run, as academic theory suggests. But it hasn\u2019t been a satisfying solution lately.Another option is to expand beyond stocks and bonds. The safest alternative is probably cash, which includes Treasury bills and money-market funds.They have been stellar performers, now that the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates above 5 percent in its battle against inflation. Increasing cash holdings and substituting money-market funds for some of your longer-term bonds has been an effective tactical move over the last year or two, and cash may be considered part of a core, classic portfolio, though getting the timing right is tricky.Shifting between cash and longer-term fixed-income holdings requires you to closely pay attention to interest rates and know when to move in and out of longer-term fixed-income holdings. It\u2019s hard to get that right.\nAnother possibility is to tweak your fixed-income holdings in terms of duration, credit quality and nationality, though indexed investment-grade holdings of bonds denominated in your home currency \u2014 dollars, if you are American \u2014 may be all you really need.Readjustments like these can be appropriate for classic, core investment portfolios.But that\u2019s about as far as I would go.AlternativesThere are many other tempting alternatives.Even those who favor core stock and bond portfolios have sometimes called for adding other asset classes \u2014 like gold or real estate \u2014 to basic diversified investments, though some studies have shown that they provide minimal protection, at best.There\u2019s no shortage of reports from asset management firms arguing that hedge funds and private equity funds need to be added into the intelligent investor\u2019s mix. And you can also delve into futures and options that can limit your losses, at a cost. Once you\u2019ve started down this route, why not go further afield? Cryptocurrency: People in the industry claim that it\u2019s an asset class and should be represented in your portfolio.I\u2019ve not seen solid evidence that any of these things are needed as core investments. As a proxy for a plain vanilla 60/40 U.S.-oriented portfolio, consider Jack Bogle\u2019s humble Vanguard Balanced fund. True, its return was terrible in 2022: minus 17 percent. But since its inception in 1992, it has gained 7.8 percent annualized, or a cumulative 900 percent. Over the last 12 months, it\u2019s up almost 10 percent. There\u2019s nothing broken about any of that.\nStocks and bonds, for the most part, are not declining in tandem this year. Diversification seems to be working again.Of course, I can\u2019t say what will happen in the future, and, clearly, the core approach won\u2019t protect you from losses all the time. But no one ever promised that it would.Keep your costs low, invest broadly \u2014 and stick with it. It\u2019s a simple approach and a proven one. Despite painful lurches, there are good reasons to believe that it will work for years to come.",

	"text": "It was a great year for the stock market and for the vast majority of investors in workplace retirement accounts.But let\u2019s not get carried away.Even after the 2023 gains, most stock investors are only barely above water since the start of 2022. It looks better when you include dividends. Then, the S&P 500 returned 3.42 percent over the course of the two calendar years. Even so, the paltry stock market increases haven\u2019t kept up with inflation.If you can stand the pain, recall the simultaneous declines in the stock and bond markets that made 2022 a terrible year for investors. It was arguably even worse than 2008, when the stock market collapsed during the great financial crisis. In 2022, bonds declined sharply in value as interest rates rose, while during the financial crisis, investment-grade bonds rallied as interest rates declined.Lately, the markets have been much kinder to investors, with both stocks and bonds holding their own.The good returns for 2023 are thanks in no small part to the brilliant performance of the last three months of the year \u2014 fueled by growing expectations that the U.S. economy will avoid a recession, and that the Federal Reserve will soon begin to cut short-term interest rates.\nThe final quarterly and annual numbers for 2023 were exceptionally good. They translate into substantial annual gains for millions of investors who hold stocks and bonds indirectly, through mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and trusts, often in workplace retirement accounts.So if you have held broadly diversified investments that track the markets, endured the bad times of 2022 and persevered through 2023, you are probably doing OK. You may even be slightly ahead of where your portfolio stood at the start of 2022.Good TidingsLet\u2019s review the good times of late 2023.The S&P 500, which tracks the most valuable stocks in the U.S. market, rose 11.2 percent in the last quarter \u2014 and had a total return of 11.7 percent, including dividends. For the year, it gained 24.2 percent and returned 26.3 percent, including dividends.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Broader U.S. stock indexes, like the Russell 3000, the FT Wilshire 5000 and the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index, which include smaller stocks as well as the giants in the S&P 500, also had a total return of around 26 percent for 2023.Rank-and-file fund investors shared in most of those gains, the database maintained by Morningstar, the financial service company, shows. The average U.S. domestic stock mutual fund and exchange-traded fund returned 11.3 percent for the fourth quarter and 20.3 percent for the year.\nNote that the average fund substantially lagged the broad stock market averages. Most funds are actively managed, by professionals trying to beat the market. By contrast, broad low-cost index funds, which merely seek to mirror the markets, generally did their job well.For example, the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund returned 12.3 percent for the quarter and 26.1 percent for the year, beating the average fund as well as the S&P 500. That, in a nutshell, is why I believe it\u2019s better for most people to use low-cost index funds.Most global markets also did well in 2023 \u2014 and, as usual, the average fund trailed the market returns. For example, an important global benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index (often known as ACWI) returned more than 21 percent in 2023. The average international fund in the Morningstar database returned only 14.3 percent Of course, some individual stocks did much better than average. Nvidia, which makes advanced computer chips, rose 239 percent in 2023. Meta, Facebook\u2019s parent company, gained 194 percent, after falling 64 percent the previous year on investor skepticism about the company\u2019s focus, back then, on the so-called metaverse. In 2023, though, these big tech stocks benefited from the artificial intelligence frenzy and lifted the S&P 500. Perhaps more surprising, cruise lines surged, too: Royal Caribbean soared 162 percent, and Carnival rose 130 percent. If you had focused on any of these stocks at the start of 2023, you would have been winner.Then again, most stocks underperformed the averages. Dollar General, Moderna and Est\u00e9e Lauder, all important S&P 500 stocks, lost more than 40 percent in 2023.\nStock picking and market timing are tricky and time-consuming. I avoid both practices and seek utterly average market returns, which are better than most active traders obtain.Enduring Bond LossesThe picture for bonds improved, too, but with a major caveat. Many people who traded bonds or held bond funds since the start of 2022 haven\u2019t yet recovered their losses.While those who bought and held individual investment-grade bonds in 2022 have done just fine, the performance of bond funds wasn\u2019t nearly good enough to make up for the declines of the previous year.When interest rates rise, as they did in 2022, bond prices fall. Bond fund returns are a combination of income and price changes, and in 2022, the price declines far outweighed the income.Fortunately for investors, that changed in 2023. The Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index, a widely followed benchmark for investment-grade bonds and core bond funds, returned 5.5 percent for the year, according to FactSet. But the losses in 2022 were so great that over two years, the Aggregate Bond index was still down 8.2 percent, and so were many bond funds.\nIt was even worse for longer-duration bonds. Because of the way bond math works, when interest rates rise, they lose more in price than shorter-term bonds. One proxy for longer-term bonds, the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF, rose 2.8 percent for 2023, yet it was still down more than 29 percent for the two years combined.The fixed-income universe is enormous. I\u2019ll return to it in future columns. But the lesson here is that while bond funds are usually steadier and safer than stock funds, that\u2019s not always the case. It depends on when you\u2019re investing, and in which bonds.So Now What?Interest rates, inflation, and the strength of the economy are key factors for both stocks and bonds.It would be good to know in advance how all these things will play out.But we don\u2019t know, and nobody forecasts well enough to rely on these predictions for investing, year in and year out.Fortunately, to prosper as an investor, it\u2019s not necessary to know what will happen in the world in the next several months or years.\nFrom a longer perspective, I\u2019d say that what we\u2019ve been experiencing over the last couple of years looks a lot like mean reversion \u2014 the markets pulling themselves back into their customary, long-term upward trajectory, after terrible trials. Expect more of the same: periodic bouts of market misery, interspersed with stretches of gains, giving long-term, low-cost, buy-and-hold investors handsome returns, if they have the strength to hang on during a tumultuous ride.I base that assertion on history. Including the final tally for 2023, the average annual return for the S&P 500 since 1926 has been 10.4 percent. That means it has taken less than seven years, on average, for the U.S. stock market to double in value.Getting those kinds of returns in the future isn\u2019t a sure thing. They certainly won\u2019t be pain-free.Precisely because there are no guarantees, this decades-long strategy won\u2019t work when your horizon is short, as many older readers have pointed out. In that situation, locking in returns at the relatively high interest rates that prevail at the moment makes more sense than a long-term, \u201cset it and forget it\u201d approach.Whatever your investing horizon, enjoy these better times in the markets but be prudent. The losses of 2022 provided a vivid reminder of how important it is to set up your portfolio so you can tolerate market agony. Hope the current calm continues but be ready for trouble, whenever it comes.",

	"text": "Last week, the Federal Reserve held off raising interest rates after 10 increases in a row, instead waiting to assess how the economy has responded to the sharp rise in rates so far. This week, stock investors also paused for reflection, putting the recent rally on hold until the outlook becomes clearer.The S&P 500 recorded its first weekly decline since early May, ending the index\u2019s longest streak of gains since 2021. The S&P 500 has risen roughly 13 percent this year, and more than 20 percent since hitting its low point in October last year, crossing a technical threshold for the start of a bull market, a term used by Wall Street to describe a period of investing enthusiasm. Even after a slump on Friday, this week\u2019s fall shaved off just 1.4 percent from the index\u2019s previous gains.Stocks of smaller companies more exposed to the risk of a slump in the U.S. economy fell further. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks these domestically focused companies, has fallen every day this week and racked up a loss of 2.9 percent for the week \u2014 its worst since the turmoil in the banking sector in March.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.A more cautious, subdued tone to the past week\u2019s trading reflected the message delivered by Fed officials: More rate increases may be necessary, further raising costs for consumers and companies, but decisions will be guided by signals from the economy in upcoming data releases on inflation, jobs and other indicators. Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said during congressional testimony on Thursday that \u201cthe data will tell us what to do\u201d on future rate increases.\nIn other words, both Fed policymakers and investors are waiting for more information to decide whether interest rates will continue to rise, which will in turn guide how the stock market reacts.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cMarkets and the Fed are looking at the same data and having the same thoughts,\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. \u201cThey haven\u2019t often been on the same page this year.\u201dLast week, the Fed acknowledged that the economy had proved more resilient than expected to the central bank\u2019s attempts to slow it down and cool inflation as a result. This week, investors appeared to acknowledge that the economy\u2019s strength may warrant higher rates: For months, investors have questioned the Fed\u2019s resolve to keep raising rates, helping propel stocks upward.Investor bets on the number of rate increases by the Fed this year have nudged higher, with investors now expecting one more quarter-point increase by the end of the year. That is still less than policymakers\u2019 own forecast, which calls for two increases this year, but it\u2019s closer than it has been in the past: Until recently, investors thought the Fed might cut rates at the end of the year.The remaining disagreement, some investors say, stems from the caution that some Fed officials have expressed about the outlook. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, had supported previous rate increases. But this week, he said that he expected to hold rates where they were now through the end of the year.\nElsewhere, other central banks continued their rate-raising campaigns this week, with the Bank of England and Norway\u2019s Norges Bank surprising investors with bigger-than-expected moves.Lauren Goodwin, an economist at New York Life Investments, said that the market and the Fed \u201chave arrived at the same interpretation of the world,\u201d which warrants a wait-and-see approach. What happens next depends on how quickly inflation falls, and \u201cthe pace of disinflation has been so uncertain so far,\u201d she said.Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",

	"text": "Gains in the U.S. stock market this year have been concentrated among a handful of immensely valuable tech companies. Technology and communications services stocks in the S&P 500 are up more than 30 percent this year to date. Consumer discretionary stocks are up this year as well \u2014 by around 18 percent \u2014 but all of the other eight S&P 500 sectors are down. Stocks in the energy sector are collectively down more than 10 percent.Of the S&P 500\u2019s 10.3 percent total return including dividends so far this year, 9.99 percentage points owe to just eight stocks, two of which represent parts of Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent, \u201cleaving a mere 0.3 percent return for the entire rest of the market,\u201d JoAnne Feeney, a portfolio manager at Advisors Capital Management in Ridgewood, N.J., wrote heading into the Memorial Day weekend.What is the hypernarrow stock market advance telling us about prospects for the economy, and should we pay attention? I can tell a pessimistic story and an optimistic story, but I\u2019m going to lean into the optimism.The pessimistic take is that it\u2019s unhealthy for a market \u2014 and an economy \u2014 when all the good news is concentrated in a handful of sectors. \u201cIt can reflect overcrowding in one area and uncertainty around the broader economy in others,\u201d Mona Mahajan, a senior investment strategist at the brokerage firm Edward Jones, wrote last week.\nStock prices reflect investors\u2019 expectations about corporate profits, and profits are tied to the performance of the economy. So there should be \u2014 and is \u2014 a positive correlation between the stock market and the economic outlook. But the performance of particular sectors also reflects factors that are unique to those sectors: oil prices, interest rates, tech breakthroughs and so on.The artificial intelligence craze is the most likely explanation for the tech sector\u2019s outperformance this year. That seems like a slender reed on which to build a broad economic expansion.But it\u2019s not so unusual for one or two sectors to power an expansion. In 1980, seven of the top 10 S&P 500 members by market cap were in energy, according to data compiled by Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Assume for the moment that only the tech sector benefits from A.I. Diversified investors still benefit from the A.I. craze because a big portion of their portfolios is in tech stocks. The people who get hired to work on A.I. also benefit. Some of them may transition into tech from sectors that aren\u2019t doing as well. Meanwhile, rising stock prices induce more consumer spending.The S&P 500 index is capitalization-weighted, meaning that the most valuable companies carry more weight. A change of 1 percent in the price of Apple shares affects the index more than the same change in the price of the 500th-most-valuable index member. You can make a case that the economy is also weighted, although not by market value: The performance of a big, powerful sector such as tech matters more to gross domestic product and even employment than the performance of, say, the materials sector.\nEven that understates the potential gains from A.I. and other tech advances. Economic historians point out that while companies on the leading edge of technology production score the early gains, over the long term most of the benefits go to the customers. Take Microsoft\u2019s Excel spreadsheet program. Sure, it\u2019s been a cash cow for Microsoft for decades. But the gains to Microsoft and its investors aren\u2019t as big as the gains to people all over the world who use Excel to run their businesses more effectively.Artificial intelligence is likely to turn out the same way as Excel. In fact, we\u2019re already seeing it. Early adopters are finding clever uses for A.I. tools such as ChatGPT, including memo drafting, language translation, software code generation and debugging. Deutsche Bank strategists recently compared A.I. with automobiles, which created jobs in not just auto production but also dealerships, road construction, tourism and the development of the suburbs.I worry about the downsides of A.I. I also worry that the U.S. economy is headed for a recession, if it isn\u2019t in one already. In spite of those concerns, I think the narrowness of the stock market\u2019s rise \u2014 so heavily driven by a handful of tech giants \u2014 isn\u2019t the problem that many strategists make it out to be.\u201cInvestor exuberance has some solid foundations,\u201d Feeney wrote. I think she\u2019s right.Elsewhere: The Minimum Wage Is Pretty MinimalThe buying power of the federal minimum wage is at its lowest point since December 1949, according to a calculation by the Economic Policy Institute. The wage floor has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since July 2009, the longest period without change in its history. Its buying power has been eroded by inflation. In December 1949, the minimum wage was 40 cents an hour, or $4.48 in April 2023 dollars. It rose to 75 cents the next month, which is $8.44 in April 2023 dollars. At its peak value, in February 1968, the minimum wage was worth $12.44 in April 2023 dollars.\nTo adjust for inflation, the Economic Policy Institute splices together several price indexes to make up for the fact that the CPI-U \u2014 the price index for all urban consumers \u2014 isn\u2019t defined consistently over time. Today\u2019s minimum wage would appear even lower, going strictly by the CPI-U, which is what the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses in its online inflation calculator.Quote of the Day\u201cA human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.

	"text": "Stocks rose for a second day on Tuesday, with shares of regional lenders sharply higher, as investors awaited a decision from the Federal Reserve on whether it will hold off on further interest rate increases that have already shaken the financial system.The S&P 500 index rose 1.3 percent, in step with markets in Europe and Asia.Bank shares rallied, as Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen expressed confidence in the nation\u2019s banks on Tuesday and suggested that the government would step in to protect smaller banks if needed. Some lawmakers in Washington are discussing ways to raise the limit for federal deposit insurance above $250,000, possibly by temporarily increasing the cap on accounts that are used for activities like payroll.Already, financial markets had begun to settle on Monday after measures were taken to shore up Europe\u2019s banks, with Swiss regulators orchestrating the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS.\u201cThe signal of confidence is what is most important,\u201d analysts at Wells Fargo noted, referring to the deal.First Republic Bank, the regional lender that has become the focus of Wall Street\u2019s concerns about the U.S. banking system, rose more than 29 percent in afternoon trading, a heady gain that nonetheless recovered only a small fraction of the value of its beaten-down shares. First Republic\u2019s stock has still fallen about 90 percent this month, erasing tens of billions of dollars in market value.\nThe bank has been entertaining some possible buyers after a $30 billion cash infusion from the country\u2019s largest banks failed to restore confidence among investors. Analysts at Morningstar \u201cstruggle with why a buyer would be motivated to step in, except perhaps if it were being pushed for by regulators,\u201d they wrote in a new report about First Republic\u2019s prospects.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Still, investors took solace from the authorities\u2019 support. An index that tracks the largest banks in Europe, which have been swept up in the turmoil after U.S. regulators seized two midsize lenders, Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, jumped 4 percent. UBS gained 12 percent in Switzerland.Shares of other regional banks also rose. Zions Bancorporation gained 7 percent, while PacWest Bancorp jumped nearly 19 percent, and Western Alliance rallied about 15 percent.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.However, investors said the current calm might portend a storm. A critical question, particularly for those worried about the effects of higher interest rates on banks\u2019 balance sheets, is what the Fed will do when its Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rate policy, meets this week.Higher interest rates have helped slow the economy and lower stubborn inflation, but they have also raised costs for companies and contributed to the instability in the banking sector. Lower rates could support the banks, but at the risk of letting inflation get out of control.\n\u201cThe competing objectives of continuing the campaign to re-establish price stability while ensuring against further banking sector contagion has presented a meaningful challenge to the F.O.M.C.,\u201d analysts at BMO Capital Markets wrote.Before stress in the banking system erupted, investors were braced for an increase of half a percentage point in interest rates. Now, the consensus is for a quarter-point increase, while some investors and economists believe that the Fed might not raise rates at all.The uncertainty shows just how quickly the banking crisis has upended views in the markets. A few weeks ago, the question was whether the Fed would ramp up the pace of its interest rate increases. Now, traders are betting on a series of rate cuts beginning in the summer.Economists have begun to warn that the trouble in the financial system could weigh on the broader economy, if lenders begin to pull back as they look to shore up their own finances.\u201cRecent events strengthen our conviction that a recession remains the most likely outcome for the economy over the next year,\u201d analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote.That is not necessarily a bad thing for markets, as analysts at Bank of America pointed out that a gauge of investor pessimism had plumbed depths associated with the low point in markets during previous cycles. In addition to the recent gains for stocks, oil prices and yields on government bonds \u2014 two key measures of concerns about the economy \u2014 rose for a second session on Tuesday.",

	"text": "Stocks in China tumbled and the currency weakened on Monday after the country\u2019s central bank announced a smaller-than-expected cut in a key interest rate.Many investors and economists had been expecting Beijing to act more decisively on interest rates as China faces falling housing prices, weak consumer spending and broad debt troubles.The central bank, the People\u2019s Bank of China, shaved only a tenth of a percentage point off the benchmark one-year interest rate used for most corporate loans, with no change at all in the five-year rate used for pricing mortgages. The slight reduction for one-year loans was the second time in two months that the government had pushed down commercial banks\u2019 lending rates.The modest scale of the cut on Monday was the latest sign that the government\u2019s usual tools for addressing an economic slowdown may have lost some of their effectiveness, economists said.\n\u201cThis will provide only modest support to credit growth and wider economic activity,\u201d Capital Economics, a London research firm, said in a note.\nGlobal investment banks have rushed to reduce their forecasts of the Chinese economy\u2019s growth, for which Beijing has a target this year of \u201caround 5 percent.\u201d UBS announced on Monday, shortly before the interest rate cut, that it was lowering its expectations for growth to 4.8 percent this year and 4.2 percent next year. Nomura of Japan is even gloomier, predicting on Friday that growth will be 4.6 percent this year while keeping its forecast for next year at 3.9 percent.The CSI 300 index of large Chinese companies traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen fell 1.4 percent on Monday, while the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong, which also includes many large Chinese companies, tumbled 1.8 percent to its lowest level since November. The Hang Seng has fallen for seven consecutive sessions and is down more than 12 percent in August.The renminbi closed weaker than 7.3 to the dollar on Monday in Shanghai trading, a level that the Chinese government tried to maintain last November, when the currency was at its weakest since 2007. It weakened even more on Monday in Hong Kong, where trading is less tightly controlled. It took more than 7.335 renminbi to buy $1 by midafternoon there.\nThe authorities in Beijing use the country\u2019s cash reserves and state-controlled banks to buy and sell currencies in an effort to limit moves in the renminbi\u2019s value against the dollar.The renminbi suddenly rebounded a bit in the final minutes of Shanghai and Hong Kong trading. The Chinese government has a long history of intervening in currency markets at the end of trading sessions to prevent closing prices from showing sharp changes.As a result, many investors view intraday movements of the renminbi, which is also known as the yuan, as a truer measure of its value.\u201cThe intraday shows you the direction the market wants to take the yuan, and the close is more likely to show you the government\u2019s action,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Enodo Economics in London.The rate cut announced on Monday was intended to make it a little cheaper for companies and households to borrow money and to make payments on existing loans. But the full effect of the reduction may be delayed because the interest rates on most loans are reset annually, often at the start of each year.\nThe central bank, in consultation with state-controlled commercial banks, reduced the one-year benchmark interest rate for corporate loans to 3.45 percent, from 3.55 percent. The benchmark interest rate for five-year loans stayed at 4.2 percent.A survey of 35 economists by Reuters last week showed that all of them expected the central bank to reduce interest rates for five-year loans as well as one-year loans. Last week, the central bank lowered borrowing costs for commercial banks by 0.15 percentage points. By making a more modest cut in the one-year lending rate and leaving the five-year rate untouched, policymakers were, in effect, widening the profit margins for banks.China\u2019s commercial banks have lent enormous amounts in recent years to developers and home buyers \u2014 the same groups that have been hit hardest by China\u2019s housing crash.More than 50 developers have already defaulted or stopped payments on overseas bonds. Country Garden has become the country\u2019s largest developer to run into financial difficulties, with some $200 billion in unpaid bills.The opaque accounting of China\u2019s state-controlled financial system has made it difficult for outsiders to discern the scale of the banks\u2019 real-estate-related losses. Wider profit margins on loans could help banks accumulate more reserves to offset these losses.",

	"text": "So many people expect a recession soon that it will almost be surprising if a downturn doesn\u2019t happen.After all, the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates for more than a year to tame inflation. Credit conditions have already tightened and some regional banks have failed. Although the job market is still stubbornly strong, even the staff economists at the Fed anticipate an economic slowdown that will be severe enough to count as a recession.That\u2019s particularly worrisome for investors because recessions are typically associated with double-digit stock market declines. In 2020, for example, during a bear market and recession near the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the S&P 500 dropped nearly 34 percent from its peak.Will we really have a recession this year? I don\u2019t know. But recessions are a regular part of life. Having experienced six of them in my career, along with countless up and down markets, I accept that I can\u2019t reliably forecast these important events, and neither can anyone else.\nYet I remain a constant investor anyway, mainly by keeping plenty of cash in safe places and by maintaining a resolutely long-term view that is grounded in history.It\u2019s not always easy to hang on. Uncertainty about what\u2019s coming next can make investing excruciating.But you may find some comfort from the past.Stocks have always bounced back after previous recessions, sometimes quite rapidly. Investment returns calculated at my request by Dimensional Fund Advisors, a large asset management company based in Austin, Texas, show that the market has performed reasonably well over periods of 10 or 20 years after economic downturns, if not always over shorter periods.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Calling RecessionsA recession is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,\u201d according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the quasi-official entity that declares when recessions start and stop in the United States.That sounds straightforward enough. But for a large and complex economy, determining when a recession has taken place is no simple matter, even after it has happened.\nThe bureau doesn\u2019t rush in making these judgments.We won\u2019t know for sure that we\u2019ve had a recession until well after it\u2019s started, and, quite probably, not until long after it\u2019s ended. That\u2019s what happened for the last recession. It started in February 2020, near the beginning of the pandemic, and ended in April 2020. But the bureau waited 15 months, until July 2021, to declare that a recession had ended. \u201cEarlier determinations took between four and 21 months,\u201d the bureau says. \u201cThere is no fixed timing rule. We wait long enough so that the existence of a peak or trough is not in doubt, and until we can assign an accurate peak or trough date.\u201dOften, stocks fall before a recession starts and rise before it\u2019s over.The economic research bureau \u201cdates recessions only after they\u2019ve begun,\u201d Marlena Lee, the global head of investment solutions at Dimensional Fund Advisors, said in an email. \u201cMarkets, on the other hand, call them well in advance.\u201dHistorical ReturnsAt my request, Ms. Lee examined all 11 U.S. recessions since 1948 and calculated the S&P 500\u2019s annualized total returns, including dividends, starting with the first day of the month after the recession started.I find these averages reassuring:One year after the starting dates, the S&P 500 returned 6.4 percent.Three years after the starting dates, it returned 12.1 percent.Five years later, it returned 10.4 percent.Ten years later, it returned 12 percent.Twenty years later, it returned 11.5 percent.Consider that, with compounding, $1 in the index would be worth $10.56 after 20 years, on average. So far, so good.Now for the caveats.These are only long-term averages, and there are big variations among them.The best 20-year return, which occurred in the two decades starting in February 1980, was 17.2 percent, annualized. That would transform $1 into $24.02 after 20 years.\nThe worst 20-year return, in the decades starting in May 1960, was 7.3 percent annualized. That would have changed $1 into $4.09 after 20 years.Obviously, I\u2019d rather have $24.02 in my pocket but even $4.09 would have represented a sizable gain.Nasty LossesThe variation in returns was much greater over shorter periods. One year after the recession of 1953, for example, an investment in the S&P 500 would have gained nearly 32 percent.But some years were truly painful. The stock market was still down one year after the start of three recessions, in 1973, 1981 and 2007. The last of those was the financial crisis, and it was the worst.One year after that recession began, the S&P 500, with dividends, was down 37 percent. Another way of putting it is that if you put $1 into the index at the start of the recession, it shrank to just 63 cents one year later.\nAfter three years, you were still in a hole: Your dollar had grown to just 92 cents. After five years, in 2012, you were ahead, but not by much. Your dollar was $1.09. The total at the 10-year mark in 2017 was better: $2.26. The 20-year verdict isn\u2019t in yet.The most recent recession, the one that started in February 2020, led to excellent stock returns quickly, despite the initial losses. After one year, $1 had grown to $1.31; after three years, it was $1.41. I\u2019m betting that it will keep rising over the next couple of decades, but there is no guarantee that it will.The TakeawayHistory is informative, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily predict the future. These historical returns may not be echoed closely enough to serve as a reliable guide. If the stock market performs much better than it has in the past, wonderful. If it\u2019s worse, you may still be all right if you are well diversified, with holdings in markets around the globe.That said, as long as the economy keeps growing despite periodic recessions, and as long as markets operate relatively smoothly, there are grounds for both optimism and caution. While I\u2019m a confirmed investor, I don\u2019t risk money in the markets that I expect to need in the next three to five years.For safety, I hold cash in a variety of places, including government money market funds and federally insured savings accounts. Bank certificates of deposit and Treasury bills are good options, too.\nFor the long haul, I invest in bonds as well as stocks in broad, diversified, low-cost index funds that mirror the entire world markets, spreading my risks. Tech stocks faltered, but energy stocks gained last year. Bonds performed miserably, but I expect they will be better in the years ahead. We\u2019ll see about all of that.Waiting many months for recession declarations, or relying on economists or Wall Street pundits to determine when to invest and what to hold all seem fruitless to me.I\u2019ll try to make sure that whatever happens, I can pay the bills first.Then, I\u2019ll continue making optimistic bets that over stretches of a couple of decades or more that the stock market will be higher than it is now, even after including those dreaded recessions.",

	"text": "One of the most important interest rates in the world this week flirted with a level it hadn\u2019t reached in more than 16 years, putting pressure on the economy and the stock market.The 10-year Treasury yield, a measure of how much it costs the U.S. government to borrow that is widely used as a benchmark for all types of lending, brushed against 5 percent for the first time since mid-2007 before ending the week around 4.9 percent.The steep rise in the 10-year yield in recent months has captured the attention of investors, economists and policymakers. This \u201csudden, rapid increase\u201d has shaken faith in the continued resilience of the economy, said economists at the rating agency Moody\u2019s, threatening \u201cto knock the U.S. economic expansion off course.\u201dThe Federal Reserve controls short-term interest rates, which ripple through the economy via market-based rates like Treasury yields and to borrowing costs on longer-term debt like mortgages and company bonds.\nBut unlike the gradual, deliberate changes to rates enacted by the Fed, moves in longer-term market rates, like the 10-year Treasury yield, are less predictable and subject to many factors. These moves are very important to the economy, and they can alter the behavior of consumers and companies faced with suddenly higher borrowing costs.As the 10-year yield has risen, the rally that propelled the S&P 500 higher earlier in the year has stalled, with the benchmark stock market index ending the week down 2.4 percent.The 10-year Treasury yield also influences important consumer rates: The average 30-year mortgage has recently approached 8 percent and credit card rates are now above 20 percent.Borrowing costs around the world also tend to rise along with Treasury yields. The effect has been particularly pronounced for emerging market economies, which have to contend with a double whammy of higher yields and a strengthening U.S. dollar, making debt payments more expensive for countries with dollar-denominated debt.Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, recently noted the rapid rise in market rates and the potential effect it could have on the economy, including the central bank\u2019s decision whether to raise its key rate again or keep it steady.\n\u201cA range of uncertainties, both old and new, complicate our task of balancing the risk of tightening monetary policy too much against the risk of tightening too little,\u201d he said on Thursday.

	"text": "It has been a fine half year for stocks, money market funds and, to a lesser extent, bonds \u2014 so good, in comparison with last year, that you may feel like celebrating when you look at your quarterly portfolio statement.But this rosy picture doesn\u2019t capture the entire situation\u00a0for the mutual funds and exchange-traded funds used by most American investors.For one thing, while the recent market returns are real enough, the reports are missing critical information that would make the returns look less fabulous.A quirk in the calendar and in government disclosure rules always makes the fund numbers look considerably better when periods of poor performance move too far into the past to be included in the quarterly reports required for publicly traded funds. That happened this past quarter, when the miserable returns of 2022 were no longer fully represented in their stark awfulness.\nFor another, bond returns, which are positive for the calendar year, have flagged recently. That\u2019s largely because of uncertainty about the state of the economy and the outlook for inflation and interest rate increases. Although inflation dropped to a 3 percent annual rate in the latest Consumer Price Index report, the Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates again at its next meeting on July 25 and 26, and could keep doing so in further meetings. Bonds could suffer.Only money market funds \u2014 often dismissed as a form of \u201ccash\u201d and not included as one of the major asset groups \u2014 are in an unequivocally positive position. Yields on the 100 biggest money-market funds tracked by Crane Data average 4.94 percent, up from 0.6 percent just a year ago, and many funds are paying more than 5 percent annually.As the Fed raises its benchmark federal funds rate, money market fund rates follow. \u201cI think they will keep grinding higher for a while,\u201d Peter G. Crane, the president of Crane Data of Westborough, Mass., said in an interview. The good times for money market funds aren\u2019t over quite yet.But for longer-term investors \u2014 those with horizons of a decade are more \u2014 the returns on stocks and bonds are more important than those for the inherently short-term money market funds. And the latest stock and bond numbers don\u2019t change the big picture at all. The stock market over long periods tends to outperform bonds and cash investment, but at the cost of much greater volatility.Gaudy ReturnsAn odd thing happened to stock and bond fund returns this year, though you may not notice unless you take the time to look under the hood, as Daniel Wiener, chairman of Adviser Investments in Newton, Mass., pointed out in an email.\nHe noted that 12-month performance tallies for a wide variety of funds had shifted from sharply negative in the first quarter this year to sharply positive in the second quarter. This shift had little to do with the recent performance of stocks and bonds.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Instead it was about what happened last year, and how the dismal market of 2022 is being recorded in 12-month performance results.\u201cMassive gains\u201d are being reported for the second quarter, Mr. Wiener said, but they shouldn\u2019t be taken at face value. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the point-in-time periods over which returns are measured,\u201d he added.Recall that the first half of last year was traumatically bad for many investors, especially the second quarter. Those four months were included in the 12-month returns that investors received in their fund statements in the spring, but they dropped out of the 12-month returns through June, the ones that people are looking at now.For example, the S&P 500 rose 15.9 percent in the calendar year through June, a big rise for six months, no question. For the 12 months through June, it rose a staggering 17.6 percent. \nBut consider the tallies\u00a0that were correct just one month earlier \u2014 yet\u00a0never viewed by most fund shareholders because these numbers didn\u2019t correspond to the quarterly reporting schedule mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.The S&P 500 rose 8.9 percent in the calendar year through May, still a decent increase. But the startling thing is the 12-month gain of that index through May was only 1.2 percent.The 12-month return in the S&P 500 jumped 16.4 percentage points in just one month.\u00a0And the higher return reported in June, the 17.6 percent 12-month increase, is the commonly seen metric, giving rise to far more optimistic feelings about the stock market than a mere 1.2 percent return.What happened? Two things.The stock market rose 6.5 percent in June. But the more consequential change was the S&P 500\u2019s 8.4 percent decline in June 2022. That year-old monthly loss was included in the 12-month return through May 2023, but dropped out in the far more important June 2023 quarterly report.A Bigger PictureUsing data provided by Morningstar, a financial research company, I found that this pattern extends across funds of many kinds.\nStock and bond investors in mutual funds and E.T.F.s. had positive returns on average for the second quarter, which ended on June 30, as well as the first quarter, which ended on March 31.Yet the average 12-month returns for stocks and bonds shifted radically from quarter to quarter, mainly because of what happened in 2022, not this year.Here are the numbers from the most recent quarter:General stock funds up 6.1 percent for the quarter; up 15.3 percent for the preceding 12 months.Taxable bond funds up 0.6 percent for the quarter; up 2.5\u00a0percent for the preceding 12 months.And here they are for the first quarter, just three months earlier:General stock funds up 5.4 percent for the quarter; down 8.3 percent for the preceding 12 months.Taxable bond funds up 2.6 percent for the quarter; down 3.6 percent for the preceding 12 months.So what\u2019s the real picture here?In simple terms, stock and bond markets are up this year but were down last year. Most investors have lost money since the market peaked in January 2022. Over the longer periods required by the S.E.C. for standard fund returns \u2014 one, three, five and 10 years and from the fund\u2019s inception \u2014 broad stock market funds are generally positive. Bond funds tend to be positive for the longer periods \u2014 five and 10 years or more \u2014 but negative over one and three years.Odd things happen for longer-term returns, too. Even the seemingly stable 10-year returns can shift sharply from month to month, altering investors\u2019 perceptions of the strength of the market. That happened four years ago.As I pointed out then, the S&P 500 plummeted more than 50 percent from Sept. 7, 2007, until March 9, 2009. But in the spring of 2019, the last of that horrendous decline aged out of the 10-year trailing stock market returns. The 10-year returns rose abruptly for hundreds of funds.\nIt\u2019s important to understand that this is happening because when evidence of sharp losses recedes into the past, it\u2019s easy to overlook the risks involved in investing.TakeawaysEven knowing that the markets periodically inflict great pain, I continue to be fairly upbeat about stocks \u2014 and the U.S. economy \u2014 for the long haul, while expecting traumas more frequently than anyone would like.So for short-term financial needs \u2014 those of the next year or two \u2014 I view the risks of stocks as way too high for comfort, and I\u2019m minimizing my holdings of long-term bonds right now, too. Bonds of short duration and, especially, cash are better for shorter horizons.Happily, money market funds are performing splendidly. They seem a good bet for the next six months or so.On Wednesday, the S.E.C. adopted a series of complex measures to enhance the funds\u2019 stability in a potential crisis down the road. We\u2019ll have to see how that plays out.\nFor now, I\u2019m pleased that my fund returns are looking much better now than they did three months ago, but I\u2019m not confident that will be true next quarter or even next month.That\u2019s not because I know where the markets are going. I don\u2019t. But I do know that they frequently fall. And I know for certain that one year ago, in July 2022, the S&P 500 rose 9.1 percent.That was good news back then. But it also means there is a strong chance that my 12-month stock market return will decline this month. That\u2019s because a gain of 9.1 percent is a high hurdle and, in any given month, it\u2019s unlikely that the market will surmount it.But buffered by bonds and money market funds, I\u2019ll invest in the stock market anyway.",

	"text": "Another midsize bank faced a crisis of confidence on Thursday, as Pacific Western Bank said that it had lost nearly 10 percent of its deposits over the last week, sparking a renewed plunge in its already depressed share price.The deposit flight, which amounts to billions of dollars, was detailed in a regulatory filing that suggested new trouble at the Los Angeles-based lender. The bank\u2019s stock fell 23 percent, a much steeper decline than other banks that have been the focus of investors\u2019 worries after the recent collapses of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank.PacWest, with $44 billion in assets and branches primarily in California, grew fast as a lender in the technology world, a similarity to some of the fallen banks that has proved unfortunate of late. In its regulatory filing Thursday, PacWest said that the seizure and sale of First Republic at the beginning of May \u201cheightened market and customer fears of additional bank failures, including PacWest.\u201dOn May 3, the bank confirmed that it was looking to sell itself or raise more money, a sign of weakness in its business that sent its shares down sharply. Around that time, the bank said that it had \u201cnot experienced out-of-the-ordinary deposit flows.\u201d\nThat appears to have changed. The bank said in the filing Thursday that its turbulent share price increased its customers\u2019 \u201cfears of the safety of their deposits,\u201d and accelerated withdrawals from PacWest accounts.PacWest now has about $25 billion in deposits, compared with just over $28 billion at the end of March. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.The new pressure on PacWest is a reminder that two months into the banking crisis set off by the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, midsize lenders remain under pressure, largely because their battered share prices are leading to worries among customers.There is no easy way out. PacWest, along with its similar-size competitors, has increasingly been relying on borrowing from the government to plug its financial holes. With inflation and interest rates rising, however, the cost of that form of financing has increased, squeezing banks\u2019 already pressured margins.In a deviation from recent weeks, when the shares of midsize banks were whipsawed en masse, PacWest took the brunt of the damage. Other pressured lenders, including Comerica and Zions Bank, traded with smaller losses on Thursday. The broader market was largely undisturbed, with the S&P 500 falling by 0.2 percent.\nWestern Alliance, a Phoenix bank that caters primarily to businesses, said in a statement that its deposits had actually risen over the past week by $600 million, or 1 percent, to nearly $50 billion. Its shares closed down slightly.",

	"text": "The stock market is on a tear, and investors face a tricky question: Will the rally last?The S&P 500 index on Friday recorded its fifth consecutive week of gains, its longest winning streak since the fall of 2021.It\u2019s a remarkable run, considering the backdrop. After a series of interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve to contain historically high inflation, many investors feared that the Fed\u2019s drastic actions would push the country into a more severe downturn. But the S&P 500 ended Friday 19 percent higher than a year ago, 23 percent above its low in October, and roughly 8 percent away from a record high.Some investors have even labeled this run the start of a bull market, or a period of exuberance that by one definition is marked by a 20 percent rise from a recent low. Once stocks cross this threshold, the bulls say, they tend to keep climbing.Others aren\u2019t convinced and warn that the recent rise could be a bear market rally \u2014 a short-lived stretch of optimism within a longer-running trend downward.\nThe case for a bull marketThe bulls base their argument on signs of a resilient economy, cooling inflation and a nearing end to the Fed\u2019s cycle of interest rate increases. If the economy has survived the onslaught of soaring inflation and higher interest rates so far, then maybe it will continue.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.Unemployment is low and consumers are spending, which has helped keep corporate profits more buoyant than expected. Inflation has moderated, and the Fed opted for the first time in more than a year to leave rates unchanged at its meeting this week.Analysts at Bank of America recently declared the bear market \u201cofficially over,\u201d noting that, historically, after rising 20 percent from a low point, the S&P 500 has continued to rise over the next 12 months more often than not. On average, the index has gained another 19 percent over that period, according to data going back to the 1950s.The fear of missing out on bumper returns as stocks continue to rise could also attract investors on the sidelines back into the market, extending the rally as they join the buying spree, the Bank of America analysts said.Analysts at Goldman Sachs last week raised their year-end forecast for the S&P 500, predicting that the index would rise another 5 percent from its level last Friday. The index has already risen 2.6 percent since then.\nOne common note of caution about the current rally is that it has been largely the result of a few big tech companies soaring higher, such as the 200 percent rise in the stock price of the chip maker Nvidia. The average stock in the S&P 500 has risen just 6.7 percent this year, less than half as high as the index as a whole.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.However, a broader rally is beginning to take hold. The average stock in the S&P had barely budged until the beginning of June, but has since posted strong gains. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks the performance of smaller companies more exposed to the ups and downs of the domestic economy, has jumped 7 percent in June alone.Why the bears don\u2019t see it that wayBears are focused on the obstacles ahead: Inflation has come down but remains high, and cracks are appearing in some important parts of the market.The downfall of three midsize banks in the spring has led other lenders to turn more cautious, restricting credit and crimping the availability of cash to companies and consumers.When it comes to banks, \u201cI think there are more weak links out there,\u201d said Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist for the Schwab Center for Financial Research.\nCorporate bankruptcies have risen, and some investors fear that this is just the start of deeper trouble, as debts with low interest rates come due and borrowers face much steeper costs to refinance. That is a particular worry for the commercial real estate market.The slow slide toward greater economic turmoil is more a result of the extraordinary amount of stimulus that had built up through the pandemic, but even that is beginning to dwindle. Consumers\u2019 savings have begun to run low and credit card balances have risen. \u201cIt\u2019s taking its time to work its way through,\u201d Ms. Jones said.The bulls believe the Fed is close to ending its war on inflation, but the bears fear that the final battle has yet to begin. Inflation is still running at more than twice the Fed\u2019s target rate of 2 percent and could remain stubbornly high. That may lead the Fed to push rates higher and, crucially, leave them high for longer, further squeezing the economy.This week, the stock market flinched when Fed officials unexpectedly forecast two more quarter-point rate increases by the end of the year. But such forecasts have been wrong before; investors quickly shrugged them off and stocks resumed their rise.George Goncalves, head of U.S. macro strategy at MUFG Securities, thinks that is a mistake.\u201cThe signaling that the Fed is doing, and the fact that they are committed to a higher-rate regime, means it is hard to fathom that we won\u2019t see other risks surfacing and breaking along the way,\u201d he said.",

	"text": "The stock market staggered to the end of its worst month of the year so far, dragged down by fears of a looming government shutdown, striking autoworkers, surging oil prices and the prospect of interest rates remaining high for longer than previously thought. Combined, they are darkening the outlook for the economy.The S&P 500 declined almost 5 percent in September, its steepest monthly drop in 2023, and extending a more modest loss recorded in August. After fading on Friday afternoon, the index also notched its fourth straight week of losses, its longest losing streak of the year.Just as a more hopeful outlook appeared to have taken hold among investors, propelled by robust corporate profits and resilient consumer spending, a series of potential problems have begun to arise, giving way to a much warier mood on Wall Street.As sentiment swings, it highlights the pendulum of worry in the markets between the economy remaining too strong for policymakers intent on stamping out inflation and the looming risks that could suddenly pull growth too far in the opposite direction.\n\u201cSentiment has soured,\u201d said Steven Wieting, chief investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth. \u201cThere is just a lot of uncertainty.\u201dOur Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.The flow of money into funds that buy U.S. stocks is roughly flat for the year, according to EPFR Global, a data provider. Nearly $1 trillion has flowed into money market funds over the same period, an investment that is tantamount to cash and seen as a haven in times of worry.Chief among investors\u2019 concerns is the prospect of interest rates remaining elevated for longer than previously thought, as the Fed battles inflation by keeping the brakes on the economy.The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond, a measure of the cost of borrowing for the U.S. government and a crucial interest-rate benchmark around the world, has risen roughly half a percentage point since the start of the month, to almost 4.6 percent. As rates on longer-dated bonds rise, stocks tend to come under pressure, reflecting higher costs for companies and consumers over the long term. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage reached 7.31 percent this week, the highest level in nearly 23 years, according to Freddie Mac.Complicating the Fed\u2019s job is a surge in oil prices, threatening to reignite inflation. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. oil benchmark, has risen to more than $90 a barrel, from around $70 three months ago, its highest level in more than a year.\nAdd a steadily strengthening U.S. dollar to higher yields and rising oil prices and investors face a trio of headwinds to the long-term performance of corporate America and the broader economy.\n\nOur business reporters.\u00a0Times journalists are not allowed to have any direct financial stake in companies they cover.\u201cThat\u2019s why investors have been having a tougher time,\u201d said Michael Hartnett, an analyst at Bank of America. \u201cMy gut feeling is hard-landing risks are growing and growing,\u201d referring to the analogy of a slowing economy as a plane touching down on a runway. Policymakers\u2019 goal is to steer the economy to a so-called soft landing, cooling inflation without pronounced economic pain.\u201cIf interest rates stay at these kinds of levels, or, God forbid, increase, that has really profound implications for global growth,\u201d said Seth Bernstein, the chief executive of AllianceBernstein, a $600 billion investment management firm. \u201cIt just seems unlikely to me that we have a soft landing,\u201d he added.Working against them is the potential government shutdown that could begin this weekend, which will weigh on growth the longer the stalemate continues. The expanding autoworkers\u2019 strike has further tempered growth expectations, though less meaningfully.The threat of a government shutdown also presents another challenge for the policymakers, delaying the release of economic data that is crucial to navigating the economy through uncertain conditions.\nThe S&P 500 is still up about 12 percent this year, but remove just seven companies from the index \u2014 the chip maker Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Tesla and Alphabet \u2014 and the rise is less than 1 percent.That lack of broader conviction is also reflected in the Russell 2000 index of smaller U.S. companies, which is barely positive for the year.Across the globe, major stocks indexes have slumped over the past month: In dollar terms, Germany\u2019s Dax has fallen about 5 percent while Japan\u2019s Nikkei and China\u2019s CSI 300 lost about 3 percent. China\u2019s slumping economy, on which many pinned their hopes for growth, has been a particular worry.One possible silver lining is that September is often one of the worst months of the year for the stock market, so the downturn may be taken with a pinch of salt. And the government could yet avoid a prolonged shutdown and striking autoworkers could secure a contract before more severe economic effects are felt. Corporate profits are expected to stabilize in the third quarter, after a sharp decline in the second quarter.But anxiety is in the air. On Tuesday, a measure of consumer sentiment sank further than forecast for the second month in a row, coinciding with the S&P 500\u2019s worst day of the week, in which the index fell 1.5 percent.\u201cThe market only a few months ago was worry free amid the belief that the Fed could engineer a soft landing,\u201d said Carol Schleif, the chief investment officer at BMO Family Office, \u201cand now the market\u2019s worry closet door is wide open as investors raise questions about the economic outlook.\u201d",

The index has gained nearly 20 percent since the start of the year, but the rally has slowed this month from its earlier breakneck pace.The Dow Jones industrial average, a collection of 30 stocks that are intended to track the broader economy, was on course for a 13th consecutive day of gains, posting a small gain in early trading Wednesday.Stock markets often exhibit caution ahead of major events like Fed meetings, waiting until there is clarity over the central bank\u2019s next move.\nMixed earnings from some of the big technology companies that dominate stock indexes also weighed on the market Wednesday, with Microsoft, which is one of two companies in the S&P 500 valued at over $2 trillion, dropping more than 3 percent.The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index fell 0.3 percent.Despite the Fed seeking to engineer a gentle economic slowdown, easing inflation by raising interest rates, the economy has proved resilient. Unemployment remains low, corporate profitability has been dented but not destroyed and household budgets are in better shape than expected.Although inflation has slowed, investors and analysts expect Fed officials to emphasize that their job is not yet over, meaning rates could rise further, or at least remain high for a prolonged period, squeezing companies and consumers.Investors have in recent days ramped up bets on the Fed raising interest rates by an additional quarter of a percentage point later this year, and will be listening to comments from the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, for signs of this in his thinking.\u201cThe U.S. Federal Reserve is not yet declaring a cease-fire with its battle on inflation,\u201d Henk Potts, a market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, noted on Wednesday morning.",

He was just over a month short of his 100th birthday.Warren Buffett, the chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, who built the company over decades with Mr. Munger\u2019s steering, said it was his partner\u2019s \u201cinspiration, wisdom and participation\u201d that had proved vital to Berkshire\u2019s success. Since the mid-1960s, Berkshire, whose collection of companies includes insurers, a railroad and a candy company, has posted annualized returns of close to 20 percent \u2014 a record that stands out for being roughly twice the rally of the S&P 500 over the same time.\u201cBerkshire Hathaway could not have been built to its present status without Charlie,\u201d Mr. Buffett said.\nMr. Buffett, who is 93, and Mr. Munger had laid out succession plans for this moment long ago, partly to limit any upheaval at the company. It was Mr. Munger himself who let slip two and a half years ago that Greg Abel, who handles all the non-insurance businesses at Berkshire and who had been among a cadre of senior employees in line for the top job, was the heir apparent.\n\u201cIn terms of the day-to-day running of the business, that was not his forte, that was not his role,\u201d said Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research who has covered Berkshire Hathaway for three decades.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cWhere Charlie Munger contributed, and where he will be missed, is in his role as a sounding board to Warren Buffett and probably one of the few people at Berkshire Hathaway who could tell Buffett how it is, stand up to him, disagree with him,\u201d Ms. Seifert said.At Berkshire\u2019s 2021 annual meeting, when Mr. Buffett and Mr. Munger were asked if the $300 billion conglomerate was too big to effectively manage, Mr. Munger said its structure \u2014 which gave the managers of its independent businesses plenty of freedom to make their own decisions \u2014 was vital to its continued success.\n\u201cWe have decentralized so much, and we have so much authority in the subsidiaries, that we can keep doing it for a long, long time, as long as it keeps working,\u201d he said.Mr. Buffett added that Berkshire had built a system that required trust and that, as a result, \u201cdecentralization won\u2019t work unless you have the right kind of culture accompanying it.\u201d\u201cBut we do,\u201d Mr. Munger replied, before an accidental show of faith that one of the most prominent contributions that Mr. Munger brought to the company \u2014 its culture \u2014 would remain after he was gone.\u201cGreg will keep the culture,\u201d he said, a nod to Mr. Abel.Alongside Mr. Abel, the longtime Berkshire executive Ajit Jain handles Berkshire\u2019s insurance businesses, with both lieutenants supported by the investment managers Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, tipped to become co-chief investment officers when Mr. Buffett steps down from his perch.Paul Lountzis, who runs an investment firm that owns Berkshire shares, has been going to Berkshire\u2019s annual meetings for more than three decades. He now attends with his son, whom he first took to the meeting in 1998 at age 11. Mr. Lountzis remembered Mr. Munger\u2019s terse, direct speaking style, in contrast to Mr. Buffett\u2019s own mannerisms.\n\u201cCharlie was very different to Warren, but they complemented each other beautifully,\u201d he said.It\u2019s that cultural impact that is hard to quantify and doesn\u2019t easily equate to a number on a balance sheet, or movement of a share price. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s Class B shares were almost unchanged on Wednesday, at around $360.Mr. Munger\u2019s death \u201ccreates a void in terms of chemistry, information flow, things like that,\u201d Ms. Seifert said.Then there is the impact on Mr. Buffett himself.\u201cI think this is a significant loss for him,\u201d Ms. Seifert said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a business relationship; this was a very deep personal relationship.\u201d",

	"text": "If the federal government defaults on its debt, the effects could be disastrous, threatening to undermine the role of the United States at the heart of global finance and tip its economy into recession. But after the government hit its debt limit and approaches the day when it runs out of cash to pay its bills, the stock market is showing no signs of panic. The S&P 500 is up more than 7 percent for the year.That\u2019s because in simple terms stock investors face a binary choice: Either lawmakers make a last-minute deal to raise the country\u2019s borrowing limit, as in the past, or the nation reneges on its obligations, with potentially catastrophic consequences that are difficult for investors to comprehend, much less reflect in stock prices.The precise day when the government would run out of cash, known as the X-date, is unknown, which also complicates trading decisions for investors. It could come as soon as June 1, according to recent comments from Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen.\u201cWhat you are seeing is a consensus view that we will not cross through the X-date,\u201d said Ralph Axel, an interest rate strategist at Bank of America. \u201cAt the moment that remains a low probability event that is hard to price.\u201d\nBut should the government run out of money, provided other workarounds fail, the effects of a debt default would hit an economy that is already on \u201crecession\u2019s front porch,\u201d said Paul Christopher, head of global investment strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.Our Coverage of the Investment WorldStock Market Peaks: If the news that the S&P 500 hit a new record is enticing you to dip a toe back into the stock market, here are some things to consider.Crypto Funds: New investment funds that hold Bitcoin have\u00a0begun trading, and it might be tempting to invest in them. Should you?Sustainable Funds: The money flowing out of funds that invest in companies with environmental, social and governance principles has gone from a trickle to a torrent\u00a0as investors sour on a sector hit by greenwashing concerns, red-state boycotts and boardroom debates.Bonds, Explained: You may not think much about them, but they\u2019re a steady counterpart\u00a0to the stock market. Here are the basics on this essential form of investment.\u201cYou are left with the question of will they default or won\u2019t they?\u201d Mr. Christopher said. \u201cThey have resolved this every time in the past, so that\u2019s the best bet, but if they don\u2019t then look out, it could be a very unpleasant surprise.\u201dPresident Biden met with Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday to discuss the debt ceiling, with little apparent movement from either side. Republicans in the House have pushed for major spending cuts as a condition for raising the debt limit. Mr. Biden has refused to link spending decisions to a debt ceiling increase. Ahead of the meeting, the S&P 500 closed down 0.5 percent on Tuesday.\n\u201cIt is really incumbent on Congress and the administration to deal with the debt ceiling, or increase the debt ceiling,\u201d said John C. Williams, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, during a meeting with reporters in New York on Tuesday. \u201cThere are a million different ways that a default like that would affect the financial system and the economy in a negative way that are deeply profound and very hard to predict \u2014 therefore, it is absolutely essential that they deal with this promptly.\u201d\nThe closest parallel to the current standoff is the brinkmanship over the debt ceiling in August 2011. In July, the S&P 500 traded near its high for that year. But by Friday, Aug. 5, when S&P downgraded the country\u2019s credit rating, the index had dropped by over 10 percent. By the following Monday, the index had fallen more than 16 percent from its July peak.Investors are aware of the risks of a repeat and, outside of the stock market, there are signs of caution creeping in. Already, investors have backed away from owning government debt that expires around the time the government is expected to run out of money.Last week, the Treasury Department borrowed money for four weeks at an interest rate of almost 6 percent, well above what it has recently paid to borrow for much longer periods, reflecting investors\u2019 unease over what might happen around the X-date.The cost to protect against the government not paying its debts, using derivatives contracts called credit default swaps, has also shot higher, suggesting a rising probability of default.Gold prices have risen more than 10 percent over the past two months, attributed in part to investors seeking out the safety of the precious metal, which is expected to retain its value through bouts of market turmoil. It\u2019s hard to untangle some of this trading activity from broader worries about the economy, especially after the recent series of banking troubles, as many investors have already positioned their portfolios defensively.\nStill, even stock investors have begun to hedge their bets, buying derivatives that pay out if there were a sudden fall in the stock market in the coming months.Stuart Kaiser, an equity analyst at Citigroup, said that he has also fielded questions from investors about which parts of the stock market are most dependent on government funding, such as health care and defense stocks. Those companies could be left with unpaid invoices in the case of a default or face cuts to future funding as part of a negotiated deal in Washington.\u201cPeople are dusting off their 2011 playbook and sharpening their 2023 pencils,\u201d he said.Jeanna Smialek contributed reporting.",
